
The eight-metre tall Pillar of Shame statue connects a Danish artist, China and Hong Kong with the commemoration of 1989 Tiananmen Massacre victims. It also reflects the development – or perhaps the deterioration – of democracy and human rights in Hong Kong. “The old cannot kill the young forever,” is engraved on the base of the pillar – above it, a towering entanglement of human suffering cast in bronze, copper and concrete. Its Chinese name, meaning “Pillar of Remembrance” or “Pillar of National Grief,” was translated by the late pro-democracy politician Szeto Wah, who formed the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China in May 1989 before the June 4 massacre.  The pillar, created by Danish artist Jens Galschiøt in 1996, was moved to the University of Hong Kong campus by students in 1997 right after being exhibited at the annual candlelight vigil in Victoria Park. Former lawmaker Albert Ho, now chair of the Alliance, recalled why they decided that the statue must be transported to Hong Kong before the 1997 Handover to China. “We fought for the statue to be shipped to Hong Kong when it was still under British rule. At that time, we had good reason to believe that this statue would not be allowed to enter after the transition,” Ho said. The Tiananmen massacre ended months of student-led demonstrations in China as the People’s Liberation Army was deployed to crack down on protesters in Beijing. UK Foreign Office files declassified last year revealed how a member of the Chinese State Council suggested that at least 10,000 civilians were killed, though estimates of the death toll vary.

In the early hours of June 5, 1997, amid scenes of confrontation with HKU campus security and the police, students managed to enter the campus by insisting it was a private area. “I said at the time – the only way to peacefully resolve the matter was to allow the pillar to enter,” Ho said. A secondary school teacher, who was in his first year of study at HKU at the time, told HKFP that he was a moderate student, but he believed the student union was doing the right thing and so joined in support.  “It was just before the Handover – as a year one student, I felt something has to be done,” he said. “But I did not expect a clash would happen.” He said he was at the back of the crowd, but was gradually pushed to the front, as the confrontation continued until 3am. “When the school made a compromise, I was glad – I had done something meaningful,” he said. “I did not think the incident would be so influential. To me, the Pillar of Shame was a symbol of the fight with crimes against humanity. We refused to let go,” he added. The Pillar of Shame. Photo: Kris Cheng/HKFP. The pillar was then exhibited at several universities, before the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Polytechnic University erected their own Goddess of Democracy statues years later – tributes to the one erected by the Tiananmen students. In 1998, HKU’s student union hosted a referendum which gave a mandate for the pillar to remain permanently at the school. However, the pillar did not disappear from the headlines. In 2008, the Alliance painted the statue orange in support of Galschiøt’s “The Color Orange” campaign, which aimed at highlighting China’s human rights violations, on the occasion of the Beijing Olympics Games. The colour, according to the artist, was a mixture of red, representing the dictatorship of China, and yellow, representing freedom and human rights. Galschiøt was invited to Hong Kong on April 30 that year – 100 days before the Olympics – but he, and his two sons who accompanied him on the trip, were denied entry at Hong Kong’s airport. After a seven-hour interrogation, they were sent back to Denmark for failing to satisfy immigration requirements. The Alliance invited the artist to Hong Kong again in May 2009 to participate in the maintenance of the pillar and events commemorating the 20th anniversary of the massacre – and he was once again denied entry. The artist’s next attempt to enter Hong Kong in 2013 was allowed.  Every year since 2002, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China has cleaned the pillar ahead of the anniversary of the massacre. This year, the ritual was held on May 4 – the 99th anniversary of an anti-imperialist movement in China led by students. Albert Ho said the washing of the pillar on May 4 held a special meaning, as students were on the front lines of both movements. “The symbol of this action is to show that we are still persisting with our dedication to the movement. Every year when we come to clean and wash this Pillar of Shame, we are trying to rejuvenate the spirit of young people,” he told HKFP, adding that it was to tell students the history of how their predecessors moved the pillar into the university.

Ho said the Alliance was in communication with student groups, and that it did not matter if they held the washing ritual together on the same day or not, as the student groups will plan their own washing of the pillar. “We agree the same thing – to commemorate those people, including young students, who dedicated their lives for the cause of democracy.” Photo: Kris Cheng/HKFP. Asked whether he was worried that the pillar would not be allowed to stay at HKU now that the political climate is changing and with a mainland-born vice-chancellor at the helm, Ho said he believed the pillar would remain. “I believe any attempts to move the Pillar of Shame would symbolise a complete stripping of the university’s freedom of speech and expression,” he said. “The pillar standing here symbolises not only its basic values – of the fight for freedom and the fight for democracy – but symbolises an even more fundamental thing, which is freedom of expression. So I think no one will dare challenge this core value.” “I hope the school understands that free thought, free speech, free expression, and free research are most important. If even these freedoms are gone, then the school should be closed down.” Photo: Kris Cheng/HKFP. During the 1989 movement, the late Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo was known as one of the “Four Gentlemen” of Tiananmen Square. His group staged a hunger strike in the final days of the protests, in hope of holding off a military clearance. His widow Liu Xia has been effectively under house arrest for years, although she has never been charged with a crime. A recording of Liu Xia emerged this week, in which she said she is ready to “die at home” in protest of her continued detention by Chinese authorities. Albert Ho said Liu suffered psychological hardship from her treatment by authorities. Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia. Photo: Handout. He said it was a disgrace that the Chinese authorities may use the freedom of Liu Xia or detained human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang as a bargaining chip in its trade discussions with foreign governments calling for their release. “Some humane foreign countries care about the freedom of we Chinese people, and care about the dignity of our people, but this is how our Chinese government behaves.” He said the Chinese government should let Liu Xia go to Germany. “If you still block her, I’m worried – many people are worried – that she will use death to resist.”  Comments

by Poornima Weerasekara Attempts to silence a student who drew attention to sexual abuse allegations at a Chinese university have inspired tech-savvy activists to use blockchain technology to dodge censors and keep the fledgling #MeToo movement alive. The uproar began when a student wrote an open letter this week accusing a staff member at Peking University of trying to intimidate her over a petition she launched urging the school to make public an investigation into a 1998 sexual abuse case. An open letter supporting Yue Xin posted at Peking University. Photo: Twitter. The student’s missive was quickly taken down from Chinese social media after it went viral, only to resurface on the blockchain service Ethereum on Monday night, attracting hundreds of comments that are virtually unassailable. “This is how we use technology to (fight) against brutal tyranny,” said one commenter, while others hailed it as a “historic moment”. The #MeToo movement has been concentrated in university campuses in China, and the authorities have tolerated some social media commentary about sexual harassment allegations in recent months. But the furore over the Peking University case appears to have been too much for censors. A search for the student’s name on the popular Weibo microblogging platform yields no results. Yue Xin, a foreign languages student, co-authored a petition with around 20 others demanding the university release details of the probe into allegations a student was driven to suicide after being sexually abused by a professor. The professor, who now teaches at Nanjing University in eastern China, was suspended pending the investigation after the allegations emerged earlier this month. In her open letter, Yue said a student adviser came to her dorm at about 1:00 am (1700 GMT Saturday) on Sunday, with Yue’s “terrified” mother in tow, and demanded she delete all information related to the petition from her phone and laptop.   A statement from the Peking University’s Foreign Languages School.   Yue wrote she had also received veiled threats from university officials over whether she would be allowed to graduate. She said the university’s actions had caused her mother to have an “emotional meltdown,” and had “broken their relationship.” “When I saw my mother crying, slapping her face, falling on her knees, and threatening to commit suicide, my heart was bleeding,” she said in her letter. ‘Symbolic move’ Chinese social media users often find roundabout ways to avoid censors. In this case, some resorted to posting a photo of the letter upside down to avoid detection technology. The text has also found an impregnable home in the hard-to-crack blockchain — a technology usually associated with cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is essentially a shared, encrypted “ledger” that cannot be manipulated. But finding the letter is not easy. It is attached to a transaction viewable on a link. Seeing the letter requires downloading the entire blockchain and searching for it with special software tools, said Leonhard Weese, president of The Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong. Embedding her message into a blockchain is “largely a symbolic move”, Weese said. “It’s true that this message cannot be deleted (or altered) from a blockchain, because all participants of the network will be forced to store it forever, but this won’t help in spreading the message,” he said. But censors would struggle to delete the nearly 300 comments that have appeared so far. Everyone who is part of the blockchain has to keep a copy of the transaction, creating multiple copies in thousands of computers, Weese said. ‘Unjust treatment’ Yue’s treatment has angered her peers. An open letter said to be from students and faculty dated Wednesday condemned the school’s “unjust treatment” of Yue. It has circulated on the WeChat messaging app. Students and alumni have vowed to boycott the university’s 120th anniversary celebration next month. “My friends and I feel disgusted. There is no reason for the school not to reveal information about the ongoing investigation,” an undergraduate student from Peking University, who requested anonymity, told AFP. “We don’t accept the school’s claim that student protesters are manipulated by external forces.” Yue and Peking University did not respond to requests for a comment. Photo: Wikicommons. The School of Foreign Languages said in a statement on Monday that the councillor called Yue’s mother “out of concern” after they were unable to reach her on Sunday. Yue was not the first student to be speak out about the case. Another student from Peking university, Deng Yuhao, wrote on WeChat that he was summoned by university authorities at midnight on April 7 after he penned a letter with others demanding transparency on the same 1998 case. His message has since been deleted. Similar cases of students being called in for questioning after signing online petitions related to other sexual harassment cases have emerged at other universities, according to Chinese feminist activist Xiao Meili. Officials at her alma mater Communication University of China had asked students whether they were “influenced by foreign forces” when they penned a letter raising concerns about campus abuse, she told AFP. “Chinese universities are wasting time clamping down on students instead of tackling the issue of sexual harassment,” she said.

Murdered HK student pregnant, Taiwan reports say  Prosecutors in Taiwan have asked the authorities in Hong Kong to provide DNA samples from a Hong Kong man after an autopsy showed his murdered girlfriend was pregnant at the time of her death, media reports say. 
Taiwan media say prosecutors have asked for DNA samples from 19-year-old Chan Tong-kai to see if he was the baby's father.  
Chan is suspected of murdering his girlfriend 20-year-old Poon Hiu-wing during a trip to Taiwan in February.  
Chan and Poon went to Taiwan together three months ago, but he returned alone. He was arrested by SAR authorities for allegedly stealing Poon's belongings and using her card to take money from her bank account, RTHK reports. 
Police in Taiwan found the body of Poon, dumped in a suitcase near a metro station in New Taipei. 
But because there is no extradition arrangement between Hong Kong and Taiwan, authorities on both sides are still assessing how to proceed with the case.

by Laurent Thomet A knife-wielding man with a grudge killed nine middle school children and injured at least 10 others as they returned home in northern China on Friday, authorities said, in one of the deadliest such rampages in the country in recent years. The 28-year-old suspect was detained and the injured children were receiving hospital treatment, the Mizhi County public security bureau in Shaanxi province said on its official social media account. Knife-wielding man kills seven students, injures 19 in NW China https://t.co/J2AZlsclLc pic.twitter.com/Nn2ATK5dKB — CGTN (@CGTNOfficial) April 27, 2018    Seven girls and two boys were killed, the official Xinhua news agency said, citing local police. The ages of the children were not given, but middle schoolers are usually between 12 and 15 years old in China. The incident took place at around 6:10 pm local time, the department said. A man surnamed Zhao from Zhaojiashan village in Mizhi County was arrested, the public security bureau said. The suspect confessed that he had been “bullied” when he attended the same Number Three Middle School when he was a child, “hated” his classmates and decided to use a “dagger” to kill people on Friday, the bureau said. A video posted by The Paper, a daily, on video-sharing website Miaopai.com shows two or three bodies lying on the ground in a narrow lane. A person is heard shouting “hurry, call the police!” Police are seen running and later frogmarching a man down the street. AFP could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.  Knife attacks are not uncommon in the country. In February, a knife-wielding man with a personal grudge killed a woman and injured 12 others in a busy Beijing shopping mall — a rare act of violence in the heavily policed capital. In the southern city of Shenzhen, a man armed with a kitchen knife killed two people and wounded nine others in a supermarket last July. History of attacks  Attacks have also targeted schoolchildren in the past, forcing authorities to increase security around schools. In January 2017, a man armed with a kitchen knife stabbed and wounded 11 children at a kindergarten in China’s southern Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. The previous February a knife-wielding assailant wounded 10 children in Haikou, in the southern island province of Hainan, before committing suicide. The man had entered the school in the afternoon, claiming that he was there to pick up his son. The attacks have led to calls for more research into the root causes of such acts. Violent crime has been on the rise in China in recent decades as the nation’s economy has boomed and the gap between rich and poor has widened rapidly. Studies have also described a rise in the prevalence of mental disorders, some of them linked to stress as the pace of life becomes faster and support systems wither. In June last year, a bomb blast that killed eight people and injured dozens outside a kindergarten in Fengxian, eastern China, was blamed on a 22-year-old introvert with health problems who had written the words “death” and “destroy” on the walls of his apartment. Material to make a homemade explosive device was found in the home.  Comments

Education chief hit for 'time-wasting' history lesson The history textbook controversy remains unresolved, with an official of the central government liaison office offering a different take on China's sovereignty over Hong Kong. "Of course China had to reclaim sovereignty over Hong Kong," the education head of the liaison office said in response to a reporter's question. The controversy started last week, when the textbook review panel, under the Education Bureau's review on senior secondary history books, decided that several statements conventionally used in textbooks - including "China insisted on reclaiming the sovereignty of Hong Kong" - should be changed because "the wording is inappropriate." Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung told a Legislative Council meeting that China always had sovereignty over Hong Kong, and so it was inappropriate to teach students that "China reclaimed Hong Kong." But he amended that the next day, saying it was all right to say "China reclaimed Hong Kong," but not "China reclaimed Hong Kong sovereignty."  Asked about the controversy, Li Lu - the director general of the education, science and technology department in the liaison office - initially told reporters to read history textbooks. When a reporter quoted former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's words that China must reclaim Hong Kong sovereignty, Li said: "Of course sovereignty of Hong Kong must be reclaimed." The Qing government ceded Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking in 1842 and Convention of Peking in 1860. Beijing regarded both treaties - signed after China lost two opium wars to Britain - as unfair and refused to recognize them. Secondary school history teacher Chen Yan-kai said it is the reason why China says it has never lost sovereignty over Hong Kong. "But words like reclaiming sovereignty, or handing over sovereignty have frequently been used in textbooks and government documents, and the central government, including Deng himself and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had been using these phrases," Chen said. Political commentator Johnny Lau Yui-siu said: "Hong Kong is very accustomed to understanding Beijing's thoughts rigidly and executing them by exaggeration, and such over-sensitiveness would push Hong Kong to death." Lau slammed officials like Yeung for making things more and more murky with "time-wasting quibbles." phoenix.un@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

When the late Cai Yuanpei, one of the most prominent educators and academics in modern Chinese history, was serving as president of the Peking University between 1916 and 1927, he had put in a lot of effort to reform and rejuvenate the institution. He once remarked that the “spirit of the Peking University” is tolerance for different opinions and the respect for freedom of thought. For the past 120 years since its foundation, Peking University and its core spirit have lived on despite the frequent regime changes in the mainland throughout the 20th century. Unfortunately, as maintenance of domestic stability has been given absolute priority over everything else after Xi Jinping took over as China’s president five years ago, it appears the century-old spirit of the Peking University is increasingly under threat. And a recent incident regarding the students’ right to know has provoked a backlash on the university campus, which, in time, could snowball into a large-scale student movement, thanks to the stupidity of the university management in handling the matter. It all began on April 5 this year, when two Peking University alumni who had moved to the US reported a case of sexual assault to the university management that took place 20 years ago and involved a former male professor with the faculty of the Chinese language. According to them, the female victim who was a student by the name of Gao Yan committed suicide shortly after she was raped. After this forgotten crime had been brought to light, dozens of Peking University students demanded that the university management reopen investigation into the case and publicize all the relevant official records. On April 9, eight students under the lead of Yue Xin submitted a formal application to the university demanding the publication of all the records on the investigations carried out by the university and the police 20 years ago, as well as the content of the confession made by the professor. Yet on April 20, the students received an official reply from the university management, which said it was unable to meet their demands because first, it is beyond its jurisdiction to ask for the police investigation records. Then second, all the related documents in the university archives, including the professor’s written confession, were lost. And it just got worse. Shortly afterwards, the students who had made the demands were summoned to speak with their professors and party officials of the university one by one. During their meetings the students were strongly dissuaded by their school leaders from continuing to follow up on the matter so as not to ruin the atmosphere on the school campus, especially as the university’s 120th anniversary date, May 4, was around the corner. As far as Yue, the student who spearheaded the initiative, is concerned, she has been simply placed under house arrest by the authorities. After weeks of forced silence, Yue finally published an open letter on the internet, in which she revealed how the university and the authorities had been trying to threaten her and her family into submission. In particular, she said she found it especially heartbreaking that her innocent mother was so scared by the relentless intimidation of the authorities that she is now on the brink of an emotional breakdown, not to mention that the incident has taken a heavy toll on her family relations. Yue’s open letter has gone viral on the internet. On the night of April 23, hand-written big-character posters in support of Yue began to emerge on the Peking University campus, only to be removed by the authorities within hours. Mainland officialdom has even gone to such ridiculous lengths to prevent the saga from continuing to escalate among the public as banning the Chinese abbreviation of the Peking University (“北大”) from all the major internet search engines in the mainland. Meanwhile, it appears that all that the Peking University management is concerned about is to make sure nothing would go wrong with the extravagant 120th anniversary party which is intended to please the paramount party leaders. It couldn’t care less about pursuing justice and upholding the students’ right to know. Worse still, the university management, throughout the incident, has demonstrated neither any tolerance for different opinions nor respect for the freedom of thought. In contrast, thankfully, the students who were at the center stage of the incident and those who supported them have manifested the same kind of progressive and righteous spirit as the one embraced by their predecessors who spearheaded the May 4th Movement in 1919. A country’s future always lies in its university students, who should have passion, aspirations and social conscience. Above all, they should also have the guts to speak their mind when it comes to upholding social justice. It would definitely be a huge loss for China if young souls like Yue and her colleagues who have great faith in freedom and democracy eventually choose to remain silent or leave for another country due to the oppressive policies of Beijing.

By Heidy Lo DSE. Three letters that strike fear into every Hong Kong student and cause debilitating anxiety. As someone who has experienced the DSE and who now works as a tutor for this year’s cohort, I want to reflect on this destructively stressful examination and its long-term effects. With this year’s exams starting, we need to raise awareness of the tremendous pressure Hong Kong students are under and be mindful of its dangers. Photo: Stand News. Hong Kong’s Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) – the public examination students take in the final year of secondary school – is among the most high-pressure exams in the world. The DSE has a relatively low coursework element and less flexibility – compared with the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the AS and A2 Level exams in the UK – so the fate of students comes down to the final two weeks of exams rather than the pressure being spread throughout the year. Furthermore, university entry requirements in Hong Kong are almost solely DSE-based, drawing a straight connection between the DSE and future employability that cranks up the pressure on students even further. According to the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the unemployment rate was 2.5 percent in January 2017 for people with a BA degree, while it is more than double that for those without one. For prestigious universities like HKU, the graduate employment rate has been close to 100 per cent for over a decade. With the DSE as the only gateway to these vital qualifications, the pressure is enormous. This can have disastrous consequences. Since 2013, the second year of the DSE, about 71 students have committed suicide. For students, there are immense stress levels and various forms of mental illness. During the last months of secondary school, work piles up, extra lessons and tutor classes take up all free time and expectations from various angles suffocate the students. Fear of missing out without a “superstar tutor” adds further worry. At the same time, tutors like Billy Ng expect students to deal with it all, saying things like: “Young people just have to get over the pressure. That’s life.” One student from this year’s cohort described the pressure they are under as “so overwhelming that I was unable to catch my breath.” A protest raising awareness of student suicides. Photo: Albert Chan. A former DSE student myself, I remember those final exams as the worst time of my life. I became depressed, suffered from high levels of stress and I can now see that my teenage self was unable to handle this stress, combined with all the other emotions of being a young person. Expectations from my family, friends, teachers, classmates and from myself pushed me close to the edge. I became unable to eat, I suffered from chronic insomnia and I closed myself off socially. I am not a social person by nature, but due to the pressure of the DSE I essentially became mute. Though I still interacted with people superficially, I never talked about my feelings and felt I should not do so because there was nothing unique about my experience: everyone was going through the same thing. After finishing the DSE, I thought I had recovered from the ordeal but even now in times of high pressure my body can revert to the intense fight or flight mode created by the DSE and the negative symptoms can reappear. The intense stress of the DSE period has a potentially traumatic effect that can remain with students long after the event. In the long term, changes must be made in universities’ entry requirements and in the DSE system itself to ease the pressure on students. In the meantime, we may have to settle for raising awareness of the pressures involved in this uniquely traumatic exam, and paying careful attention to those going through the process in the next two months. Heidy Lo is a survivor of the 2015 DSE. She is a local student in Hong Kong completing her undergraduate degree in English and working as a tutor of DSE students.   Comments

Social welfare sector lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun has hit out at Chief Executive Carrie Lam for neglecting to mention the problem of student suicides in her policy address. During a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Council on Thursday, Shiu told Lam that there were two instances of suicide and attempted suicide earlier that day. A CUHK student was taken to the hospital around 2am after a suspected suicide attempt, and an 11-year-old boy in school uniform died after falling from a building in Tai Po, according to Ming Pao and RTHK. Carrie Lam. Photo: HKFP/Catherine Lai. “Over the past two years, there have been over 72 suicides among young people, from primary school students to postgraduate students. 72 is not a number; it concerns stories, and lives,” Shiu said. “In the policy address, the focus is not on housing, but on developing the economy, benefitting those with invested interests, innovation with One Belt One Road, massive infrastructure projects… it’s all about money.” “What is the price of a young person’s life? What is the price of 72 lives?… Under what circumstances will you properly and solemnly respond to the problem of youth suicides, and host a summit on youth suicides? It’s only by respecting death that you can respect life,” Shiu said. In response, Lam said that there was “no need to use such emotional language,” and added that she started being concerned about youth suicides when she was the Director of Social Welfare. “If you ask Professor Paul Yip, who has done the most research on suicides in Hong Kong, I have long demonstrated concern over the issue and in order to facilitate his research, I have requested that departments make numbers available to him.” Shiu Ka-chun holding a list of dates on which students committed suicide. Photo: HKFP/Catherine Lai. She also said that she does not recall any requests for a summit, but promised to ask the Secretary for Labour and Welfare to follow up. Earlier this year, concern groups petitioned Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, urging him to hold a summit on youth suicides. Lam stressed that “the government cares a lot about mental health issues, especially those relating to young people.” Her policy address did not mention student suicides specifically, but it said: “Based on the evaluation results of the Student Mental Health Support Pilot Scheme, we will consider ways to provide appropriate support services for students with mental health needs.” If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255.

Heartbreaking article the other week about examination stress. Apparently since the Diploma of Secondary Education came into full flowering in 2012 about 71 students in the relevant age group have eluded the examiners by killing themselves. The writer, who still had fresh memories of passing the ordeal herself, thought this was shocking, and so do I. It is always difficult to be sure of the motives of people who commit suicide, and there is a tendency for one reported case to inspire imitation. Even so, I remember the days when a toll of one or two suicides in an examination season was considered bad news. We are now, it seems, running a rate of something over ten a year. A protest against student suicides. Photo: Albert Chan. The writer noted that the DSE, compared with other similar exercises, lacks continuous assessment. That is to say, your final score depends entirely on the two weeks of frantic writing at the end of the course. There is no credit for school work done earlier. She also noted that in Hong Kong the DSE was practically the only input used by universities in admissions decision-making. That, I can confirm, is certainly the case. When four-year degrees arrived, the committee of university heads decided (this was not a necessary feature of the new system) to abandon the old arrangement by which a course selected its own students. In future admission would be by faculty or school. This means that anyone working on admissions is faced with a crowd of thousands from whom they have to pick a hundred or two. No detailed consideration is possible. The exam score is effectively all there is. The only other indicator of any interest is the student’s choice. I remember several attempts to float scoring systems for extra-curricular activities, with bonus points ranging from – say – one for doing a Red Cross flag day up to ten for an Olympic medal. None of these came out as very convincing and I don’t think anyone is using one now. There is also the familiar point that a university degree means less now than it did in the days when it was a rarity. The unfortunate consequence of this is that employers who really do not need people with a university degree still use it as a way of reducing their pool of applicants to a manageable size. If you haven’t got one your application is rejected out of hand. Hong Kong Baptist University. Photo: GovHK. This leads to the suspicion that – as one of Michael Moore’s interviewees puts it in Bowling for Columbine – if you don’t graduate you will die poor and lonely. Your future – not to mention your parents’ happiness – is at stake in the DSE and failure to meet expectations is a major personal catastrophe. I do not, I must say, remember similar angst over the corresponding examinations through which I plodded many years ago. The writing was all done in two or three weeks – continuous assessment had not been invented – and we had to do the whole thing twice (it was called O and A Levels). It may be that as a sort of supergeek for whom examinations came easily I missed symptoms of tension in my classmates. But there is not much privacy in a boarding school. Then maybe we were let off the hook by the 11 plus. This was an exam (which was supposed to be a mere “IQ test”) taken at the end of primary education. It may have caused some stress, but most of us were too young to take it that seriously, and at least the stress did not coincide with teenage turmoil. Those who took the exam were then allocated either to Grammar Schools (this outcome was familiarly described as “passed”) or to Secondary Modern Schools, which were noticeably less affluent and prestigious (“failed”). There was supposed to be a third category of Technical Schools for the NCOs of industry, but few of these actually appeared. Everyone in my school had, by definition, “passed” the 11 plus. So we may subconsciously have thought that we already had Business Class tickets for the 747 of life. Getting into university was still very unusual. For most of us it was hoped for but not expected. Perhaps, raised on the stories of our parents’ privations in World War Two, we set the bar for complaints a bit higher than it is set now. Employers, anyway, rarely insisted on a degree. Many professions which now require a degree, including the Law and journalism, still admitted most of their recruits fresh from school. The University of Hong Kong. Photo: 马克爱生活 via flickr. This absence of stress at school was more than compensated by a surplus at university. The one I attended offered an idyllic existence for three years. You then had a week of “Finals” which was rather reminiscent of that legendary Chinese examination in which candidates for the civil service were shut up in a room for a week and told to write down all they knew. We had six hours of exams on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Sunday off, six hours on Monday and a last burst on Tuesday morning, after which there was an understandable tendency for the exhausted examinee to get resoundingly drunk. An oddity I noticed on arrival was that all student rooms had brand new electric fires. This was because the university had decreed, after a spate of student suicides using gas, that all gas fires should be replaced with something less obviously lethal.  This was a success. Nobody killed him or herself while I was there. Some people continued to get special dispensation to take their Finals in the local mental hospital. In small colleges there was constant vigilance. I remember the Dean of my place, seeing me sitting on the steps of a church (I was waiting for a friend) drew disturbing conclusions about my state of mind. He stopped his car in the middle of the street, ignored the ensuing hoots of outrage from other motorists and ran across to ask if I was alright. At the University of London I heard of an odious arrangement in some of the more sought-after science programmes. They would admit about 20 per cent more students to the first year than they had places for in the laboratory subjects which started in the second. At the end of the first year the bottom 20 per cent in the pecking order were simply expelled. The results of this can be imagined. One of my first attempts at journalism was a column in a student publication at the University of Lancaster drawing attention to two recent attempts at suicide (both, fortunately, half-hearted and unsuccessful) and wondering if exam stress could be reduced as this seemed to be a cause. University of Lancaster. Photo: Geograph/Ian Taylor. I then got a polite hand-written letter from the Vice Chancellor saying that he was willing to try anything, but reducing the significance of exams appeared to be not so much a way of reducing stress as a way of spreading it over a longer period. We discussed the matter further and agreed that a student counselling service was a good idea. As I was the student union president at the time this proposal was sure of a favourable wind from several directions and materialised rather quickly. I do not know if it helped. And this gets us back to where we started. Yes, the DSE is a stressful experience which some victims do not survive. But what would help? I suppose there is no practical objection to spreading the exams over, say, four weeks instead of two. Would that reduce stress or spread it out? Using continuous assessment of school work is a big ask because it puts teachers in a complicated situation. How much help is permissible; how much benevolent marking do their pastoral obligations require? It seems also that while the student whose continuous assessment is successful can comfort himself with the thought that he enters the exam room with some money in the bank, as it were, the student who is less successful in term time may find the exam an even more onerous and frightening ordeal than if he was allowed to start from scratch. Students taking Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (DSE). Photo: HKEAA. Counselling can help, and a lot of people now offer it. I fear those who most need it are the least likely to ask. The unlikely reform which I think would help is giving more thought to the idea that the entire student population should take the same exam. The consequence of this is a large group of candidates entering the examination room knowing that their chances of passing are minimal or non-existent. A further large group in the same boat may not realise this until they see the actual questions. When I took the French Oral exam (a one-to-one chat with visiting examiner) we were admitted in alphabetical order. The first person out was besieged by an eager crowd asking what the examiner had wanted to talk about. Unfortunately this boy was not a strong candidate. “I don’t know,” he said, “she was talking in a foreign language.” Seriously, though, the business of preparing people for an arbitrary and unnecessary encounter with failure is gratuitously cruel. There may be something in the idea that those who aspire to life’s glittering prizes should be willing to suck it up and tough it out on occasion. The rest of us do not need to be prepared for a seat at the back of the bus. Life will provide us with as many examples of failure and rejection as a sane person needs. We do not need an extra dollop from the education system.

The government is under pressure to take measures after three student suicide cases were reported in one day on Thursday. One of the victims, an 18-year-old secondary 6 student, was saved by passers-by after he jumped into the river from a pedestrian overpass near the Tai Po Mega Mall, Apple Daily reports. He was in his school uniform.  A source said pressure from schoolwork drove him to try to kill himself. At around 7 a.m., an 11-year-old primary six pupil was found lying on the ground at Kwong Yau House in Kwong Fuk Estate, a public rental housing estate in Tai Po where he and his family lived. He was rushed to hospital where he was later pronounced dead. Investigators said the boy jumped off the building because he could not deal with the death of his grandmother and the impending divorce of his parents. A secondary six student also died in hospital after he jumped off the top of the Domain Mall in Yau Tong at about 11:21 a.m. Police recovered a note at the scene, in which the 17-year-old said he was under pressure and felt he had no direction in life. Social welfare functional constituency lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun and the Civil Alliance for Student Suicide Prevention urged the government to take action to prevent a recurrence of the incidents. They proposed a government-led anti-teenage suicide summit to help tackle the problem.  More than 20 students have committed suicide so far this year, according to Apple Daily.

More than 100 people took part in a barefoot march on Sunday in Hong Kong, calling on the government to pay more attention to the issue of student suicides.  The rally, led by members from two concern groups — the Civil Alliance for Student Suicide Prevention, and Parents United of Hong Kong — saw the participants walk from the Legislative Council to the Chief Executive’s Office without any footwear. During the event, protesters demanded that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor take the youth suicide problem seriously and carry out changes in the education system, Apple Daily reports. The march came amid mounting concerns among parents, teachers and social workers after Hong Kong witnessed 74 student suicides in the city between August 2015 and October 12 this year. During the rally Sunday, protestors took off their shoes and placed them on a black banner on the floor, with all 74 suicide dates marked out on the banner in order to remind the public of the tragic incidents. Each pair of shoes represents one forgotten child, the Civil Alliance said. By visualizing the suicide cases in such a way, the group said it hoped to raise awareness in society about the problem. After the demonstration was over, the protestors all bowed down in silence as the dates of the students’ suicides were recited. However, neither Carrie Lam nor any staff from the Office of the Chief Executive met with the groups to receive their letter. Both the organizations backed Legislator Shiu Ka-chun’s idea that the government should launch a summit to handle student suicide problems, news website HK01.com reports. The idea was rejected by Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Law Chi-kwong, with the official arguing that a high-profile summit would only “spread the infectious idea of suicide”. The concern groups responded by stating that the summit would not tackle each suicide case individually, but will only discuss ways to improve the entire system as a whole. The organizations will meet with the Education Secretary Kevin Yeung Yun-hung soon to discuss the topic. They have also arranged to meet the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, and Secretary for Home Affairs. A teacher surnamed Yam said he joined Sunday’s protest because he believes the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education examination is causing too much stress for students. Yam told Apple Daily that each time a student commits suicide, he feels as if he himself had been the executioner as he had been teaching them and giving them homework. A parent at the protest, a woman surnamed Wong, said that her daughter had been forced to start writing at the young age of two. She pointed out that the child has come under great stress and had felt unhappy because she could not write the characters properly. As the Hong Kong education system puts too much stress on results, many schools had pushed their students too hard and made matters worse. A spokesperson from the Civil Alliance, Cheung Sau-yin, called on the government to establish an inter-departmental committee to solve the problems of mandatory social workers at schools. If that is done, many problems can be looked into with more effective communication, Cheung said. Tong Chung-yee, a spokesperson for Parents United, noted that authorities had started a program where schools were given HK$200,000 funding for promoting mental health, under the “Joyful at School” initiative. However, she cited official statistics as showing that only 40 percent of the schools had been given the green light for the program. Given this situation, Tong urged the government to allow more schools to benefit from the scheme. - Contact us at [email protected] EL/BN/RC 
Station sterilized after meningococcal outbreak The MTR has sterilized Kowloon Tong station after a platform assistant was diagnosed with an invasive meningococcal infection. The Centre for Health Protection is investigating the case, which involves a 60-year-old man with an underlying illness. He has had fever, cough and generalized weakness since April 8.  The man was admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital the next day and transferred to the intensive care unit. He is in critical condition. His blood culture tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis and he was diagnosed as suffering from meningococcemia.  The MTR confirmed the patient was a station assistant at Kowloon Tong station. It ordered a thorough cleanup of the station.  "As a precaution, we have followed CHP guidelines by deploying cleaners to clean thoroughly the station, using bleach at the station area, and we also arranged enhanced cleaning of air filters," a spokesman said.  As normal procedure, facilities on trains and in stations such as escalators, ticket machines, ticket gates and lifts are cleaned every four hours with 1:99 bleach water solution.  The MTR has alerted station staff to symptoms such as fever or coughing, and to seek medical treatment as soon as possible and alert their supervisors in the event they have such symptoms, the spokesman said. The CHP said meningococcemia is a communicable disease transmitted by direct contact through respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, from infected persons. The incubation period varies from two to 10 days, though usually from three or four days. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. The disease can cause brain damage or even death. The brain damage may lead to intellectual impairment, mental retardation, hearing loss and electrolyte imbalance. Invasive meningococcal infections can be complicated by arthritis, inflammation of the heart muscle, inflammation of the posterior chamber of the eye or chest infection.  The CHP reminded people to wash their hands properly, especially after sneezing.  Separately, it reported an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in a primary school in Tai Po yesterday. The outbreak affected 23 students, 15 boys and eight girls, aged 8 to 11, who have been suffering from vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pains and fever since April 10. Among them, 20 sought medical attention, but no one required hospitalization.  CHP officers conducted a site visit and provided health advice to the school staff relating to proper and thorough disinfection, proper disposal of vomit, and personal and environmental hygiene.  The school has been placed under medical surveillance. riley.chan@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

No let up in student suicide battle Schools are better prepared to prevent student suicides this year, but more needs to be done through social media, an expert says. "Apart from talking about classes, the schools also tell students to seek help if they have problems," said Paul Yip Siu- fai, the head of the Education Bureau's Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides. "We have more preparations than before, but we will not relax," Yip said yesterday. Yip, director of the University of Hong Kong's Center for Suicide Research and Prevention, was appointed last year to head the panel following a spate of student suicides. The committee's final report and recommendations were submitted to the then-secretary for education Eddie Ng Hak-kim in November. Yip said the committee is discussing with social-media giants, including Facebook and Google, about procedures for handling signs of potential suicides on the internet and how to find those students as quickly as possible. He said students express such signs in many ways. "It is not necessary that they will release these signals through phone calls - they can be on WhatsApp, in emojis or by leaving comments on Facebook," he said.  Yip said the authorities also helped teachers to improve their ability to detect students who have problems, and to put more resources in the education sector. He also appreciated the positive changes in media reports, saying there were fewer sensational reports about students committing suicide in the past six months. The Social Welfare Department's Child Fatality Review Panel released its third report on Thursday, saying there were 20 child or youth suicide cases among 206 deaths of children aged below 18 in 2012 and 2013 reported to the Coroner's Court, including those who died of natural and non- natural causes. It also said children and youngsters committing suicide were mainly due to "schoolwork problems, worries about their futures and relationship problems with family members or boyfriends or girlfriends." Yip quoted the report as saying about 70 percent of children who committed suicide showed suicidal signs but adults sometimes ignored those signals because they were too busy.  The associate director of the HKU center, Liu Kwong-sun, said parents have to spend more time with their children and communicate with them directly, including using the internet. Liu also said students face much greater pressure than previous generations. Parents and teachers should also help children to improve their emotional management skills and not just focus on academic results. Today's Standard

 Suicides in Hong Kong Tools include flagging worrying posts and featuring help tips more prominently Comments:    A government-appointed student suicide prevention committee has been in talks with Google and Facebook on how to identify and help young people in Hong Kong who have suicidal tendencies. Citing an official report released last week on child fatality, Professor Paul Yip Siu-fai, who chairs the committee, said on Sunday that about 70 per cent of young Hongkongers who committed suicide had shown warning signs in different ways. “We have been discussing with Google and Facebook how to respond actively when some people show warning signs online and how to identify this group of people as soon as possible,” Yip said. “These signs may not just be a phone call, but also WhatsApp messages, emojis and Facebook posts.”  Facebook has introduced a suicide prevention tool enabling users to flag posts from friends who show warning signs. The company then sends a list of options to the people whose activity has raised concern, including reaching out to a friend, contacting a helpline or viewing tips. Yip said the committee wanted to work with the company to establish a pattern of suicidal Facebook posts and set up an “early warning system” based on the data.  He explained such a system could automatically detect suicidal cases and allow reviewers to send reminders to the individuals concerned, their friends or schools, based on their posts. Yip noted worries about potential privacy issues in the plan, but he said most people who were suicidal would “not find it intrusive” because they were looking for help when posting alarming messages.  Google has been featuring search results about suicide prevention help and tips more prominently when users look for particular combinations such as “ways to commit suicide”. Yip said the committee had been discussing with the company ways to improve the resources for Hong Kong users. The committee was set up last year after a worrying spike in the number of youth suicides in the city. While 71 pupils took their own lives between 2013 and 2016, 23 cases were reported in the 2015-16 school year – seven in a span of 10 days. As hundreds of thousands of pupils started going back to school last Friday, the issue was again brought to public attention. Dr Liu Kwong-sun, deputy director of the Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, said many clinical cases showed suicidal intentions existed among pupils in local, direct-subsidy and international schools, students at universities and even adults who had just left the education system and started work. “This shows that the society-wide expectation of students is very high, much higher than what students can afford,” Liu said on a radio show on Sunday. “We did not have this environmental pressure in the last generation. “Could there be more room for [suicide] prevention?” Liu expressed hope the Education Bureau and schools could focus less on academic performance and more on young people’s emotional education, to encourage perseverance, responsibility and confidence.

Schools fail yet again in abuse watch Two boys who were allegedly abused by their mother told teachers they were injured after fighting with one another. It is the second instance where a school failed to detect a suspected child abuse case, after five-year-old Chan Sui-lam died in January following suspected abuse.  The two, aged eight and 10, appeared in a video which went viral on the internet over the weekend. The clip shows one boy with his hands tied up outside a toilet, and another boy being hit by his mother in a playground. The brothers are Primary Three and Five students in the ELCHK Faith Lutheran School in Shek Kip Mei.  The school's principal Leung So-wan said that teachers noticed red marks on their faces. But, when asked what happened, the boys said the injuries were from fighting with each other. She said the incident happened after school at the brothers' home. Asked if the brothers had told the school about their mother hitting them, Leung said they "did not ask help from us". She described the brothers as normal children who were not absentees at school. Their father used to take them to school when they were smaller, but now they go on their own.  The principal said the school had activated its crisis management mechanism, and it had met after finding out about the incident.  She said the Education Bureau and the Social Welfare Department were also keeping tabs.  Leung also said teachers and staff of the school would check with the students and parents on finding any suspicious injuries on children.  It is the second instance of a school failing to detect a suspected child abuse case. Last month, media reported that there were photographs showing that the Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery in Tuen Mun was aware that five-year-old Chan Sui-lam was being abused months before her death. Meanwhile, the mother yesterday denied abusing the two boys, and said she loved her children. She told local media that the footage was made by a man who sexually harassed her. She believed the man uploaded the clip on the internet in order to damage the relationship between her and her sons.  However, police arrested the 41-year-old mother, Cheung, on suspicion of ill-treatment or neglect by those in charge of child or young person, in Shek Kip Mei Estate.  After initial investigations, police said the woman in the clip allegedly abused her sons in middle of last year.  The woman also has a five-year-old daughter, who was being sent to the hospital for a check-up with the brothers.  Lawmakers also raised concerns over child abuse cases in Legco yesterday.  Police said they handled 1,400 criminal cases relating to family violence last year. However, Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung said the government had failed to analyze the trend of domestic violence.  He asked if the government would consider implementing a compulsory notification mechanism for frontline professionals to report cases of suspected abuse.  sophie.hui@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

A jury at the Coroner’s Court unanimously decided that a student from Chinese YMCA Secondary School in Tin Shui Wai committed suicide last year, hk01.com reports. After the decision on Tuesday, Coroner Ko Wai-hung told family members of the 17-year-old student not to blame themselves but to find strength to continue living as the accident no doubt has had a great impact on them. The student was found lying on the ground in front of a building on the school campus on Aug. 5 last year. With multiple body injuries, he was rushed to Pok Oi Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. Investigation led police to believe that he jumped to his death from the sixth floor of the building after he returned to school to turn in his summer homework. The student’s mother told the court on Tuesday that her son had never shown any inclination to harm himself. Footage from security cameras on the campus showed Lee walking by himself to the sixth floor before he climbed over the fence and jumped.

Education University (EdUHK) and the Education Bureau have condemned messages that “congratulated” a government official’s son after his death. The eldest son of Education Undersecretary Choi Yuk-lin died after falling from a Tsim Sha Tsui flat on Thursday morning. The reasons for the incident are still unknown. Signs bearing the slogan “Congratulations Choi Yuk-lin’s son on going west” subsequently appeared on the campus’s Democracy Wall, on top of banners supporting freedom of expression and Hong Kong independence. Signs saying “Congratulations Choi Yuk-lin’s son on going west” appeared on top of other signs protesting the removal of banners advocating independence on Education University’s Democracy Wall.

EdUHK issued a statement condemning the signs and apologising for any hurt they may have caused. “The school would like to reaffirm that, whilst we enjoy our rights to freedom of expression, we should also use a peaceful and reasonable attitude to discuss different events, and respect others’ feelings. In this case, the offensive acts are shameful – we hope that the posters of the signs will be able to self-reflect,” it said. The university said that it is reviewing CCTV footage and will take action where necessary. Messages attacking the family were also posted online: “You knew that your son was depressed. Instead of spending time with him, you accepted a promotion and became even busier, leaving your son to be taken care of by a domestic worker. What an educational role model! You don’t even know how to be someone’s mother, how can you educate other people’s children? You are such a failure, you should resign,” one commenter said on discussion forum LIHKG. Another user attacked the Education Bureau for not “breaking a sweat” sooner over previous teacher and pupil deaths. Localist lawmaker Cheng Chung-tai aired similar sentiments on Facebook: “Now that something has happened so close to you, Education Bureau official, do you finally feel the cruelty of the education system? Don’t say that the people piling on are being insensitive – because these are the seeds that you have sowed.” ‘Inhumane monsters’ The Education Bureau (EDB) said that it “severely condemned the vicious and maliciously offensive behaviour” of the people responsible for the signs at the university, and thanked school authorities for taking immediate action. Choi Yuk-lin. File Photo: Apple Daily. On Thursday, pro-Beijing lawmaker Ben Chan launched a petition urging EdUHK to find the person responsible for the signs. “Demand that Education University use CCTV to uncover the inhumane monsters, and expel them from the school, to prevent this animal from becoming a teacher and misguiding their children!” he said. The university’s student union issued a statement saying that it was not responsible for the signs, and that it had sent representatives to take them down. It said the university should not use the event as an opportunity to curtail students’ right to freedom of expression. “We have still not been able to confirm if the involved party is a student of the university. In any case, it is clear that if a student is punished by school authorities as a result of a morally controversial statement, it will lead students in the future to be scared of expressing their views, self-censoring, and creating white terror on campus,” said the statement. The union said that the university should respect the autonomy of the student union in managing the Democracy Wall. “Whilst we disagree with Ms. Choi on her educational policy, we will not kick someone when they’re already down due to a difference in opinion. We hope that the deceased is able to rest in peace,” it said. Choi was appointed education undersecretary in July despite controversy over her pro-Beijing political stance.

Public outrage is pouring out over vicious comments posted on a wall of a school shortly after a son of Education Undersecretary Christine Choi Yuk-lin jumped to his death from the family home on Thursday morning. Poon Hong-yan, Choi’s elder son, jumped from the family’s 41st floor flat at Sorrento in West Kowloon, police said.  The comments surfaced on the “democracy wall” of the Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK), hk01.com reports. The messages were removed by school authorities who called them offensive and shameful.  EdUHK apologized to the victim’s family and urged students to respect others when expressing their views. The school is investigating CCTV footage in order to find the persons responsible and will take take the necessary steps. Principal Stephen Cheung Yan-leung said through a spokesperson that the events have “completely crossed the lines of all human reasoning”. Cheung said that he has received a lot of comments from the public, expressing outrage over the incident. It is not known whether or not people running the democracy board were involved but Cheung said they would investigate the events thoroughly and hand out the appropriate punishments. Meanhwile, EdUHK warned students to obey the law and observe school policies when using the school’s facilities. Also, the university students union reminded its members that vindictive and hurtful language is not allowed on the democracy board. An Education Bureau spokesperson slammed the “inappropriate comments”, saying they have brought shame to their perpetrators and to the university. It applauded the EdUHK for its swift action in taking down the messages. Legislative councilor Ip Kin-yuen also expressed his disappointment at the events. He said despite holding different political views with Choi, he felt deeply for her loss. Ho Hon-kuen, vice chairman of the pro-establishment Education Convergence, issued a statement to condemn the incident, saying that using “congratulations” when someone has died is a great disrespect to both the living and the deceased. - Contact us at [email protected] EL/BN/RA 
There has been a rise in student suicides in the city in recent years. More than 60 youngsters took their lives between September 2015 and April this year, or an average of three students each month. When there are so many such tragedies, society appears to have become accustomed to the situation, as if it’s the new “normal” in today’s Hong Kong. And a vicious circle seems to be happening; more suicides “goad” more disgruntled students to take the same path. Parents, and society as a whole, need to do some soul-searching as to what factors are pushing our students off the edge – heavy loads of schoolwork, anxiety over academic records, disputes with family members, relationship problems with boyfriend/girlfriend, etc. A student who grows up in a happy family is unlikely to commit suicide. Parents and other family members are the first and last ones that a student with suicidal issues can count on. One’s bond with parents may slacken during adolescence when the emotionally tumultuous period is often aggravated by inadequate communication with parents and disagreements over choice and outlook. Instead of trying to rein them in and forcing them to accept a set of values, parents should be more accommodative to their kids, who are in a precarious stage of transition toward adulthood. Treating adolescents with respect and showing them that we are willing to listen to them can go a long way in helping them sail through a bewildering period in their lives. The home can be a safe haven and a launch pad for youngsters as they explore and decide on the path of life they should take, and especially when crunch time comes. But if parents always resort to censure and suppression whenever their kids revolt against their expectations or simply become less tractable, they risk alienating the young adults, who may choose some radical ways to escape from bridled circumstances rather than seeking help from the family. This may add up to their feeling of estrangement, which may lead them to consider suicide as an option. A lesson from many rueful parents is that some students may try to keep their stress under wraps even when they have long been feeling despondent or even thinking of ending their lives. Parents need to spend time with their children to listen to their views and anxieties. Psychologists tell us that taking one’s own life is a result of long planning and emotional struggles, which always involve a host of factors. Spur-of-the-moment suicides are exceptionally rare, as they are against human nature and instinct for survival. It may take up to 90 days, with multiple phases, from thinking of suicide to actually committing it. These phases can be summarized by five Ds: difficulty leads to disorder, then to desperation, and in turn a decision to end one’s life, including when and how.  The final stage is “discharge”, in which he or she may dispose of items they used to love or value a lot. Parents must ask themselves: Does suicide really occur without any indication, or is it just that parents fail, or are too busy, to take note of them?

A 14-year-old boy ended his life on Tuesday morning. He was the fifth to die in six attempted suicides by Hong Kong students within 17 days. The boy wore a school uniform when he died at Wah Fu Estate in Aberdeen around 7am. Wa Fu Estate. Photo: Wikicommons. His suicide may be linked to a scolding by his parents for spending too much time on computer games the night before, local media reported. The school said in a statement that its teachers and students were devastated by the news. It has set up a crisis management group and urged parents to notify the school if their children appear to be in distress. Another suicide A separate student suicide took place last Friday. A 15-year-old boy who attended an international school took his own life at Times Square in Causeway Bay at around 10pm. He told his family that he was unhappy at school prior to his action last Sunday, according to local media. The student was an enthusiast in rooftopping, a practice of taking photographs at the top of skyscrapers. He left a note on Instagram thanking his friends and social media followers before Sunday. His family has since switched the account from public to private. See also: HKFP’s comprehensive guide to mental health services in Hong Kong Time Square. Photo: Google Street View. Last Monday, a 15-year-old student ended his life in Ma On Shan, possibly related to worries over academic grades. Two student deaths from suicide were reported immediately after the end of the Lunar New Year holidays. A 16-year-old died on February 5 in Ma On Shan, while a 13-year-old died on February 6 in Tsing Yi. A 12-year-old student attempted suicide earlier this month, also reportedly due to academic pressure. She was prevented from doing so by firefighters and police officers. Last year, 35 cases of student suicide were reported.

Call to limit student study hours Concern groups proposed the setting of "standard studying hours" to reduce student stress and help to prevent suicides. Youngsters face enormous pressure under the current education system as apart from attending school, many also go to tutorial classes.  Extended study time leads to insufficient sleep and play, said the groups  Social Workers Align With Students Under Pressure and Citizens' Alliance for Prevention of Youth Suicide. On World Suicide Prevention Day yesterday, the groups urged the government to face up to the problem of students taking their own lives and consider setting regulations or guidelines to restrict the number of study hours - similar to standard working hours for employees. Over the past two months, the groups interviewed 631 students, parents, teachers and social workers, and some 90 percent supported the idea of standard studying hours. More than 70 percent believed a maximum of seven hours of study a day would be appropriate, including time spent at school and tutorial classes. Lai Pak-yin, spokesman for Social Workers Align With Students Under Pressure, said many secondary school students spend around 10 hours on their studies every day, with some even taking longer than that. He also said government suggestions for tackling student suicides are not practical for frontline teachers and social workers - it is more important to stay with students when they are going through a hard time than training them to have a positive attitude. Chan Chi-chung from Citizens' Alliance for Prevention of Youth Suicide said there should be fundamental changes in the education system, as academic studies are the main source of pressure for students. Chan also said the government should do more to create family-friendly employment practices, as many parents are too busy at work and cannot help their children in time when they have problems. Annie Cheung Yim-shuen from Parents United of Hong Kong said many parents lacked knowledge on childhood mental health. "Sometimes young people cry, go quiet, or slam the door shut, but parents often neither realize these are signs of problems nor know how to handle the situations," she said, adding the government should strengthen education for parents and provide more support to schools. Cheung said studying seven hours a day is already a long time, and many students do not get eight hours of sleep. The groups are continuing the survey until next month to gather views on ways to reduce students' pressure. They also urged the government to hold a student suicide prevention summit to listen to opinions from society. Today's Standard

Two Hong Kong secondary school students have committed suicide in the space of 24 hours after the Chinese New Year holidays. On Sunday at around 9am, a 16-year-old male secondary school student took his own life at Lee On Estate, a public housing estate in Ma On Shan. Lee On Estate. Photo: WiNG via Wikicommons. The following day at around 6am, a 13-year-old female secondary school student took her own life at Cheung Ching Estate, a public housing estate in Tsing Yi. The Education Bureau said that it was very saddened by the incidents, Apple Daily reported. It said that the relevant schools have activated their crisis response groups, and that the bureau has sent staff to the schools to provide support. The bureau also referred to the final report of the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides, published last November, which said that suicides were caused by multiple complicated interacting factors. The bureau added that it was following up with and implementing many recommendations made in the report, such as reviewing the education system to better emphasise non-academic achievements. The committee had been established by the Education Bureau in March 2016 following a spate of student suicides. The Education Bureau. File Photo: Apple Daily. On Monday, lawmaker Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu published an email he received from a form three secondary school student, criticising the Education Bureau chief Eddie Ng Hak-kim for claiming last October that student suicides could be prevented by better life planning. The student said that he was stressed over academic results because of the education system: “Like most of Hong Kong’s students, I can’t see any future. I’m studying repeatedly every single day, but I don’t understand the point of it.” 35 cases of student suicide were reported last year.

Two student suicides lead to alert for schools and parents Two secondary students have taken their own lives in the past two days, prompting another call for the government to review the education system.  Experts also urged parents to be caring and attentive to their teenagers instead of being critical. At 6.50am yesterday, a 13-year-old girl was found unconscious outside Hong Cheung House at Cheung Hong  Estate, Tsing Yi, after a fall. The girl, who was in her school uniform, was rushed to Yan Chai Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.  A suicide note was found and it is believed the girl was troubled by academic issues. Yesterday was the first day of school after the Lunar New Year break.  The grieving family went to the scene in the afternoon to mourn their loss, with the mother heard crying: "Mommy won't shout at you again. Mommy is here to bring you home."  A 16-year-old youth plunged from Lee Hing House at Lee On Estate, Ma On Shan, at about 10am on Sunday.  He was confirmed dead at Prince of Wales Hospital. No note was found.  Suicide Prevention Services executive director Vincent Ng Chi-kwan said his group's hotlines receive more than 3,000 calls a month on average, with about 500 from people aged 24 or below. Most of the young users who were emotionally troubled or even suicidal reflected pressure from school work and family issues.  Ng told parents to look for signs, including if their children have lost weight, lost interest in activities they used to be passionate about and if they are giving away items they treasure a lot or stopped caring about their appearance.  Some may even voice suicidal thoughts, Ng said.  But first, he said: "Parents should be attentive to their children. If you don't know them well, you won't be able to pick up those clues." He suggested parents to be caring to make their children feel supported, but warned them not to adopt a critical attitude. Last year, Hong Kong saw a spate of student suicides, prompting the government to appoint the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides.  But education-sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen said he did not see much change following the committee's work. Ip again expressed disappointment with the committee report, which concluded that "there is no direct correlation between student suicide cases and the overall education system."  He called upon the government to review the education system by canceling unnecessary assessments that burden pupils and looking into the student-teacher ratio.  Today's Standard

Calls for a review of the education system are growing after the back-to-back suicides of two young students soon after the Lunar New Year holidays. The victims were a 13-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy who apparently fell to their deaths, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports. The girl was found unconscious on the ground outside the Cheung Hong Estate in Tsing Yi where she lived with her family. She was last seen alive leaving home for school at around 6 a.m. A note and a new pair of black shoes were found next to her body. Police said the girl could have been feeling depressed before she decided to end her life. The actual cause of death is being investigated. Her death came just one day after a young student plunged to his death in Lee On Estate in Ma On Shan. Lawmakers are calling on education authorities to strengthen their efforts to prevent a similar tragedy. The Education Bureau cited findings by an investigation committee that student suicides are often caused by “multiple complex reasons” that influnce one another, Apple Daily reported. It promised to implement the committee’s recommendations, including a review of the entire education system and putting more weight on students’ non-academic achievements. Ng Wai-han, a senior social worker at YWCA, said many young people face pressures from schoolwork and interpersonal relationships, and they are especially vulnerable to post-holiday depression. She urged them not to put themselves in a dead end but open their minds to talk out problems. Parents should pay more attention to their children, she said. Meanwhile, Civic Party lawmaker Alvin Yeung posted to Facebook a letter sent to him by a Secondary Three student who complained that many of his peers can’t see the future since all they do every day is learn without really understanding. Yeung urged Secretary for Education Eddie Ng to take a closer look at the defects in Hong Kong’s education system. EJ Insight supports efforts to help people deal with depression and related issues.

Suicide survey shows new alert for school pupils An alarming 30 percent of senior primary school students and 40 percent of junior secondary school students are at risk of suicide, says a new survey. The Hong Kong Jockey Club and City University of Hong Kong interviewed 464 Secondary One students from four schools and 449 Primary Five and Six students from two schools last September and October. The survey found that 31.6 percent of primary pupils and 40.3 percent of secondary schoolchildren are considered vulnerable - scoring 11 or above out of 30 in the suicidal risk assessment.  Nearly half of the vulnerable cases indicated that they have a suicidal wish.  Applied social sciences associate professor Kwok Lai Yuk-ching noted that Secondary One students face an especially high suicide risk. "As secondary One students need to adapt to many changes, including a new learning environment, social circle and physical changes during puberty, they are more likely to be emotionally stressed and develop a suicidal wish," Kwok said. "We need to pay more attention to their emotions." Kwok advised parents to find solutions with their children and also let them make decisions so the kids know they are able to handle and control the environment. The survey also showed that if students feel hopeless and perceive themselves as a burden to others, they are at higher risk of suicide. If they feel happy and recognize their self-worth, the risk is lower. Chow Mung-sze, a mother of a Secondary Two boy and a Primary Two girl, said her children experienced emotional problems frequently.  "My daughter always gets upset and cries a lot. She even told me she wanted to commit suicide when she was in Primary One because she could not adapt to the huge pressure from dictation and examinations," said Chow, who joined the workshop of a project run by the Jockey Club-funded Suicide Prevention Services in the spring. "I used to ask my daughter: 'Why are you crying again in the early morning?' to stop her from crying immediately," Chow said. "But after the workshop, I realized that I should recognize her negative emotion and try to set goals and find a solution together. Now I have better communication with my children and I am happy to see my daughter smile again." Suicide Prevention Services executive director Vincent Ng Chi-kwan warned that now is a high-risk period for students' emotional and suicidal problems as the final exams are approaching and the public examination result will be released soon. "Instead of saying it is not a big deal and we have all experienced the exams, we should put ourselves into their shoes and show we understand their problems, and we will stand by them through the obstacles."

By Kelvin Lee Recent suicide cases among primary and secondary students have drawn fresh scrutiny to Hong Kong’s education system. Parent groups pressed for the removal of Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA), a standardized test aimed at evaluating school performance, dubbing the exam a major source of stress and anxiety among students. Lawmakers and parents at Thursday’s anti-TSA campaign event. Photo: Lau Siu-lai, via Facebook. The Education Bureau disagrees, and fought tooth and nail for the survival of the exam. It went as far as to change the name of the exam from TSA to Basic Competency Assessments (BCA), even after then-Chief-Executive-elect Carrie Lam signalled her intention to suspend the exam. While the outrage of parents is understandable, perhaps even justified, the Education Bureau’s strong desire to monitor school performance is in fact, quite justifiable. After all, as the regulatory body that oversees education institutions, it is responsible for ensuring school quality. TSA/BCA currently evaluates school performance by measuring student academic proficiency. Much like any other public examination in Hong Kong, this means looking at the absolute score a student achieves in the exam, and absolute score alone. If the score passes a threshold set by the Bureau, the student is deemed “proficient”. If enough students hit “proficient”, the school is deemed “proficient”. However, students don’t all start with the same level of academic mastery. In other words, the exam is not a level playing field. It is impossible for educators to set a one-size-fit-all proficiency target that is fair – rigorous enough for everyone, yet attainable enough for everyone. A uniform threshold almost guarantees that some will find it not rigorous enough, while others will find it not attainable enough. This means: some will struggle with all their might, while some, as my high school teacher would say, cruise through the exam. File photo: Labour Party. But more troublingly is how this “proficiency gap” came to be. Citing Albert Shanker Institute, The 74’s Matt Barnum noted that only 20% of “variation in student achievement is explained by differences in schools”, and that “out-of-school factors, like poverty”, have a “significant effect on learning”. Further exacerbating this effect is the failings of our education system. Most so-called elite schools, which were originally public, made the switch to the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS). This has led to the blanket exclusion of poor kids from elite schools. With endowment funds of some of these semi-private DSS schools hitting more than HK$30 million, one can only imagine the uphill battle to keep up with the proficiency target for schools with less resources and more disadvantaged kids, and feel pity for the students who have fallen victim to a system stacked against them. With so many factors affecting a student’s abilities, the report concludes, implementing a proficiency-based exam will only “reward schools for the students they take in”, but not how they teach. “Impact of TSA-related stress on our bodies” poster and items commemorating students who ended their lives. Photo: Parents United of Hong Kong. Perhaps it is time for the Bureau to rethink its approach to school performance exams. The ‘growth’ approach Educators have long debated the “how” in evaluating school performance, and according to Brookings Institute, there is a “growing consensus” among educators that an approach which measures student academic growth is more appropriate. One of the reasons is because it improves the “proficiency gap”. By setting rigorous and “long-range” goals that span through multiple school years, the American Institute of Research found that teachers can bring “students who perform far below proficiency to grade level”. According to the institute this might even close the “achievement gap” between rich and poor kids. But perhaps the most convincing argument for a growth-based system is its ability to recognise that the definition of a “rigorous yet attainable” proficiency level varies from student to student. In a growth-based system, a teacher does not have to force students to do an unreasonable amount of exam drilling exercises, just to make sure students hit that arbitrary but all-important proficiency target. With a system that “recognizes teachers’ efforts with all students”, a teacher can set “a realistic learning goal for all students”. A sign rejecting the TSA exam during the 2017 July 1 rally. Photo: HKFP/Ellie Ng. Indeed, there are drawbacks to growth-based school performance exams: the risk of not reaching “proficiency” at the end of the 12-year schooling comes to mind. That is why it is also necessary to have proficiency-based in-school and public exams, which Hong Kong is not short of, to serve as counterbalances to growth-based examinations. While it is unfortunate that it took the tragedies of student suicide to bring renewed attention to pressures students face in school, a closer examination behind the causes of these pressures must continue. Changing a defective examination system should only be the first step. Kelvin Lee is a business student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.  Comments

A 15-year-old secondary school student has taken his own life on Sunday morning. He was the third to die in four attempted suicides by Hong Kong students within eight days. The boy died at Kam Tai Court, a public housing estate in Ma On Shan around 9am on Sunday. Kam Tai Court. Photo: Chong Fat via Wikicommons. HK01 reported that his suicide may be related to worries over academic grades, as his secondary school was about to announce results. Last Wednesday morning, a 12-year-old student attempted to take her own life at Lower Wong Tai Sin Estate, also reportedly due to academic pressure. She was prevented from doing so by firefighters and policemen. The latest incidents follow two student deaths from suicide immediately after the end of the Chinese New Year holidays. A 16-year-old died on February 5 in Ma On Shan, while a 13-year-old died on February 6 in Tsing Yi. Kam Tai Court on Sunday. Photo: Apple Daily. 35 cases of student suicide were reported last year.

A 15-year-old secondary student plunged to his death on Sunday in Ma On Shan, the third such case in eight days. The boy is believed to have jumped off the roof of Kam Pong House in Kam Tai Court around 10 a.m., am730 reports.. Police said the victim might have committed suicide due to pressure from schoolwork. He was studying at a Band 1 secondary school in Ma On Shan which was about to hand out report cards, according to Apple Daily. The victim texted his parents that he wanted to kill himself at around 9 a.m. on Sunday but they could not locate him. The incident was the latest in a string of deaths by young students. A 16-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl fell to their deaths on Feb. 5 and 6, respectively, while a 12-year-old girl was saved by firemen when she tried to jump off a building in Wong Tai Sin on Feb. 8. Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong Center for Suicide Research and Prevention said the incidents could be related to pressure from studies. He said the victims also might have been having emotional problems or poor interpersonal relationships. Hsu Siu-man, supervisor of the Youth Wellness Centers of the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, said students could be copying suicides from previous cases. People should talk to others when they feel they are under pressure, Hsu said, adding that academic results are only part of a person’s life. She said parents should also pay close attention to any abnormal behavior by their children. EJ Insight supports efforts to help people deal with depression and related issues.

Nearly 10 per cent of primary school students demonstrate symptoms of serious depression that require clinical attention, a new study has shown. Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service distributed questionnaires among 1,301 primary three to primary six students across 14 schools between January and March this year. The NGO estimated that over 33,000 of the 349,000 primary school students in the city suffer from clinical depression and require therapy and treatment. Clinical psychologist Ester Lee. Photo: RTHK screenshot. Over a fifth of students said that they often experience stress from their heavy homework load, academic performance and preparation for secondary school. “Children may not use the same methods as adults in expressing their inner thoughts – so we would look at more extrinsic factors, such as those relating to the physical body. For example, their sleep may be affected: they may sleep too much or experience insomnia, or they may have poor sleeping quality and have a lot of nightmares,” said clinical psychologist Ester Lee Ming-lam a press conference on Sunday. Lee added that some children may also suffer from stomachaches, diarrhea or other health problems. See also: HKFP’s comprehensive guide to mental health services in Hong Kong Other behaviours to watch out for include instances of the student’s academic results taking a turn for the worse; if they refuse to hand in homework; or when they show reluctance in going to school, Lee said. The study also found that a lack of psychological resilience – meaning the ability to face pressure and handle emotions – was one of the biggest factors in childhood depression, and that these children tend to avoid things that trigger negative emotions and take to the extremity. Photo: GovHK. The NGO recommends that parents talk to their children more and spend more time with them, as well as stay calm and take note of each other’s emotions when responding to them. Social welfare sector lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun told Chief Executive Carrie Lam last month that there have been over 72 suicides among young people, from primary school students to postgraduate students, over the past two years.

Depression 'hitting 10pc' of primary kids Children as young as six were found to be developing symptoms of depression, while the youngest case to be diagnosed with the mental illness was 10, according to Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service. The non-government organization surveyed 1,301 primary school students aged nine to 13 from 14 schools in Hong Kong in the first three months of the year. Almost 10 percent of the students  showed serious depression symptoms and needed clinical attention, according to the findings. It was also found that 21.7 percent of interviewees reported that they often felt stressed, which the NGO said was 5.5 percentage points more than last year and a three-year high. The most frequently reported stressors were heavy schoolwork, choice of secondary school and poorer than expected academic results, it said. While most students were found to not suffer from depression, 13.2 percent were troubled by depression symptoms, including 9.7 percent that required clinical attention. "Estimating on the primary student population of this academic year, which is 349,008, the depressive tendency over 33,000 primary students has reached clinical level," a spokeswoman said. More than 10 percent of students experienced symptoms such as fatigue and reported feeling useless, she said. Other symptoms included reduced interest, loss of appetite and weight. The NGO found that the lack of psychological resilience was the most prominent risk factor for depression among students. Ester Lee Ming-lam, a clinical psychologist at the NGO, said children with this condition are more prone to avoid and repress unpleasant memories. But she said this could lead to more negative thoughts and affect their emotion and behavior, leading to serious consequences such as suicide. Lee urged parents to interact with their children as it builds a better bond and can dissipate any pent-up emotions the youngsters may be withholding.  She also said parents should not focus solely on academic results and should look to nurture other values such as confidence, empathy and creativity. The NGO said parents have a role in spotting the symptoms of depression as children may lack the confidence to open up about their psychological problems. Today's Standard

Suicides rising among youth, survey finds  The number of young people committing suicide has continued to increase, data analysis by a suicide prevention centre shows.  
The Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention estimates that the suicide rate for people aged between 15 and 24 was 8.9 per 100,000 last year – up from 8.4 per 100,000 the year before.  
It said according to the coroner's court, 69 people under the age of 24 took their own lives last year.  
The suicide rate of people younger than 15 went up from 0.2 per 100,000 in 2015 to 0.5 per 100,000 last year.  
But the center said it expects the situation to improve over time after the government rolled out a number of prevention measures last year.  
The center said the overall number of suicide cases has been decreasing over the years, and the elderly remain the age group with the highest suicide rate. But it also said the overall suicide rate in Hong Kong is on the lower side when compared globally. 
The director of the centre, Paul Yip, said many NGOs provide support services for people who lose their loved ones to suicide.  
He added that those around the bereaved should show sympathy as it takes a long time for people to recover.-RTHK

Cold-blooded trolls mock grieving mother Online trolls hurled verbal abuse at Peter Poon's grieving mother, Christine Choi, yesterday. And posters were put up on the notice board at the Education University of Hong Kong "congratulating" Choi on her  son "going to heaven." The president of the university slammed two students for putting up the posters, adding that a full investigation will be launched. Mental health professionals and commentators condemned the "cold blooded comments," pleading for the public to show some empathy for Choi who had lost a son. On social media, one troll said the son's death was "karma slapped in her face," referring to education policies they were unhappy with. "Instant karma is a f***ing b*tch," said Facebook user Gravit Zen. Alvin Ng said that Poon took his life due to "poor life planning" in a take on former education secretary Eddie Ng Hak-kim, who had linked poor life planning to a worrying spate of student suicides. Hong Kong Unison founder Fermi Wong Wai-fun, a social worker, said: "Political disagreement should not justify gloating over someone's death. "What Choi's family needs now is empathy and condolences. It is humanity and respect to others on the basic level." Ip Kin-yuen, chief executive Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union, who defeated Choi in the September 2016 Legislative Council election, said: "I call on them [trolls] to stop and recall their comments." Political commentator Ivan Choy Chi-keung said: "People online don't need to take responsibility for their words, thus people expose their angelic and devilish sides - and this time it's more of the devil. "Of course, social divide played a part in it, but I believe the internet exposes this evil side in many parts of the world." Some netizens also mocked the former education secretary Eddie Ng Hak- kim when his mother died in March and his wife died in June. Paul Yip Siu-fai, psychiatrist and director of the University of Hong Kong Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, agreed most internet comments were inappropriate. As for Peter Poon's death, Yip admitted it was extremely difficult to recover from traumatic accidents. "Poon had made lots of high accomplishments before, yet he was struck with the accident," Yip said. "It was inevitable to feel frustrated that you could not do what you used to do, like you were at a trough." He advised those suffering major life changes to try to reset more realistic goals. Yip also warned against the impact of sensationalization of news on those living with "black dog" depression. "Media should refrain from over- reporting suicide news," Yip said. Today's Standard

A 17-year-old Secondary Six student plunged to his death from a school building in Tin Shui Wai. The incident took place at YLPMSAA Tang Siu Tong Secondary School at about 8 a.m. on Monday, Apple Daily reports. Police said the boy left a note, based on which they suspected he was stressed out over family and academic issues. The victim was found on the ground in front of the school building by students gathering for a morning assembly. He was rushed to hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The case has been listed as suicide, pending further investigation. It was understood that the boy had to attend after-school classes four days a week to prepare for the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) examination scheduled for April next year. He had reportedly sought help from the school’s social worker. The school said it formed a crisis management team soon after the incident. About 20 students are in need of emotional counseling, it said. Ng Po-shing, director of the student guidance center of Hok Yau Club, said Secondary Six students are normally under great pressure because of the coming DSE exam, hk01.com reported. He said students should try to turn pressure to motivation by clarifying the goal of study and finding ways to ease it, such as by sharing their feelings with friends, doing certain activities and seeking professional help. Tsang Chin-kwok, director of the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong, a suicide prevention organization, urged parents to pay more attention to their children’s emotional changes, especially if they appear too quiet, spiritless or confused. EJ Insight supports efforts to help people deal with depression and related issues. Here is the 24-hour multilingual suicide prevention hotline of The Samaritans: +852 2896 0000 (or email [email protected]). – Contact us at [email protected] TL/JC/RA 
A 19-year-old Baptist University student from Tai Po took her own life on Monday afternoon – the third such case in four days. The incident was possibly linked to academic pressure, and there were no suspicious circumstances, the police said. File photo: Wikicommons. At around noon last Friday, a Secondary Five student took their own life. According to the police, the 16-year-old was unhappy because of school work. On the same day, a Form Two student took her own life at her apartment block in Tin Shui Wai. The victim had suffered from mood swings owing to extracurricular commitments, the local newspaper Ming Pao reported. See also: HKFP’s comprehensive guide to mental health services in Hong Kong In March, a copy of the Education Bureau’s “no-suicide contract” was widely circulated on the internet, after seven student suicide cases emerged in the space of nine days. The document came from an eBook published by the Bureau aimed at preventing student suicide. As debate flared online, HK Psychologists Concern said that contracts are a “commonly used and effective method” for therapy sessions. It urged netizens to stop criticising the contract so that students who seek help will not lose confidence in the document. No-suicide contract. Photo: Gov HK. James Hon Lin-shan, the former chairman of the Council on Professional Conduct in Education, wrote on Monday in an Apple Daily column that the root cause of youth suicide is the Bureau’s indifference to students’ academic stress brought about by the imbalance and failure of the education curriculum. “Changing the government and education system is the only way to eradicate the problem from its root,” the column read. Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim said in October that poor life planning is a reason students take their own lives. His comments were based on a report from the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides.

An elderly man has been sentenced to a year in prison for animal cruelty after 10 dogs starved to death in his Yuen Long village house last year. Deputy Magistrate Frances Leung also fined 68-year-old Chan Sing-cheong HK$4,000 on Monday, reported Headline Daily. Chan Sing-cheong. Photo: Apple Daily. Before the Lunar New Year holidays, he pleaded guilty at the Tuen Mun Magistrates’ Court to a charge of animal cruelty and to eight charges of keeping dogs without a licence. Chan kept a total of 18 canines and a cat at his house in Nam Hang village, Yuen Long. On June 30, neighbours called the police after discovering animal carcasses and a foul smell emanating from the site. Chan previously took his animals out often, but had stopped doing so in the days leading up to his arrest, reported Ming Pao. Eight dogs and one cat were still alive at the time of the discovery. Tuen Mun Law Courts Building. File photo: Wikicommons. Announcing the sentence, Deputy Magistrate Leung told Chan that he should have either asked someone else to take care of the animals or freed them from his house before leaving. Chan had reportedly taken the animals into care because he did not want them to suffer abuse from others. But he suddenly left his house last year, claiming that it was haunted by ghosts.

By Odilon Couzin Last week, in response to criticism from parents, teachers and many others, the chairman of the EDB’s Committee on Prevention of Student Suicide, Professor Paul Yip, wrote a column in SCMP defending the committee’s recent report. In it, he wrote that those who testified in Legco last week were “misinterpreting” the report’s message, that they were trying to “only blame the school system” rather than recognizing the “complexity of the suicide situation.” This couldn’t be further from the truth. All serious research on suicide recognizes that there are usually multiple factors, nobody is suggesting otherwise, and this is a crude attempt to discredit anyone who dares to criticize the report. A student suicide protest. Photo: Albert Chan. True, many of those who spoke up in Legco focused on the intense pressure that students experience in Hong Kong schools, but their testimony was largely a response to the clear attempt by the EDB and its hand-picked committee members to downplay or even deny a link between schoolwork and tests and the sort of psychological pressures that can lead to self-harm and suicide among students. This is not a misinterpretation. The report goes to great pains to avoid saying that academic pressure is an important factor in student suicide. It ignores much academic research and even Hong Kong government reports that contradict this conclusion. The wording of the report’s denial is chosen carefully, as if written by a lawyer or politician trying to squirm out of a tight corner. For instance, it claims “there is no substantial direct link between student suicides and the education system.” But there are plenty of links, and  a mountain of clear evidence linking school and test pressure to student suicide. The Social Welfare Department issued four “Child Mortality Review” papers covering the years 2006 – 2011 that showed schoolwork pressures were linked to between 29% and 42% of youth suicides. According to the Committee’s report, the EDB’s own data showed that 24% of Primary and Secondary school students who committed suicide were known to be worried about their academic performance, but this is somehow ignored in the report’s conclusion. Surveys conducted among Hong Kong students show an alarmingly high percentage consider suicide, and that the biggest sources of pressure in their lives are tests and homework. Finally, many works of academic research have shown there is a strong link between school pressure and student suicide. Those who spoke up last week were not misinterpreting the report. For parents, teachers, and so many others who care deeply about the well-being of Hong Kong’s children, this sort of blatant doublespeak is simply not acceptable. Photo: Apple Daily. While the report makes a number of useful recommendations about increasing budgets for psychological support to students and parents, expanding service referral via the schools, and educating society about the risk of suicide, it fails to make any serious recommendations on how to reduce pressure on students. Like a 2011 EDB guide on preventing student suicide, the report focuses on measures to help students learn how to deal with extreme pressure rather than trying to address the source of the pressure itself. In fact, the solution is there for all to see.  In 2000, the Education Commission issued a comprehensive Education Reform proposal. That proposal called for a “paradigm shift” away from high-pressure tests, cramming, and rote memorization, and said that less testing and a “flexible and open curriculum framework” would produce better long-term educational outcomes. While EDB officials say this is still their blueprint for education reform and pay lip service to the goals of a balanced and flexible education, they seem to have moved in the opposite direction. Eddie Ng Hak-kim (left) and Paul Yip Siu-fai (right). Photo: GovHK. Yip writes that we should “look for evidence-based measures to make our work more effective and to ensure the school system helps those in need.” We couldn’t agree more, and we believe the evidence in this case is strong and clear: excessive testing, homework, and academic pressure may produce high test results, but they are overwhelming  Hong Kong’s children and this must be faced head-on. A frank and honest public discussion, followed by comprehensive reform of the education system is urgently required, because all Hong Kong students are at risk.

Flu fears over schoolgirl's death Health authorities are trying to establish whether the death of a Heep Yunn School Primary Five student could be flu-related. The girl, surnamed Lau, aged about 10, is reported to have suffered from acute septicemia and pneumonia after catching the flu.  In a circular sent to parents, the school said Lau died on Sunday midnight. It did not specify the cause, but stated that a team has been formed to counsel students.  "The school has set up a crisis management team following the death of the student. Educational psychologists, teachers and social workers will provide emotional support to students if needed," the school in Kowloon City said in the circular. The girl fell sick last Monday and saw a doctor the next day. She went to a private hospital on Wednesday where she was admitted until she was referred to a public hospital for an emergency operation on Thursday, according to the circular. The school refused to comment on the incident yesterday, citing privacy issues.  A spokesman for the Centre for Health Protection spokesman said it had approached the school regarding the issue, and no outbreak of infectious disease had been reported there so far.  Flu activity in Hong Kong currently is at a low level. Infectious disease specialist Joseph Tsang Kay-yan said it is very common for the flu virus to trigger secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumonia.  According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: "Flu virus infection of the respiratory tract can trigger an extreme inflammatory response in the body and can lead to sepsis, the body's life-threatening response to infection." Tsang urged the public to receive the flu vaccine ahead of the winter.  "People should still get vaccinated even though there was an alleged vaccine mismatch before," he said. "Regardless of the coverage, there is still a cross-protection effect." The government procured 460,000 doses of vaccine for the winter flu vaccination program that began on October 18.  It contains the Hong Kong H3N2- like virus based on the World Health Organization recommendation in February for the northern hemisphere, in which Hong Kong falls. But a WHO meeting in Melbourne in September decided that for the southern hemisphere's 2018 flu season, the vaccine mix should do away with the Hong Kong strain, and replace it with the Singapore-like H3N2 virus which emerged in the city-state in 2016. The move had put many in fear, as the recent summer flu peak season, the fiercest on record, killed 431 people including three children. Today's Standard

The driver in the fatal Tai Po double-decker crash on Saturday was previously convicted of careless driving, according to the Kowloon Motor Bus Company (KMB). 19 people were killed and over 60 were injured when the bus overturned on Tai Po Road. On Saturday, Li Chi-wai, police senior superintendent in New Territories North, said they suspected that the bus was exceeding the speed limit and lost control while going down the hill. The 30-year-old driver was arrested for dangerous driving causing injury and dangerous driving causing death at the scene. Photo: InMedia. The police are investigating various leads and are not ruling out manslaughter charges, according to Ming Pao. A conviction of causing death by dangerous driving could lead to up to ten years imprisonment and a fine of HK$50,000, while a manslaughter conviction could lead to life imprisonment. Speaking at the scene on Saturday night, KMB representatives said that the driver had a good record, and that it was not his first time driving the route. The driver – Chan Ho-ming – had been employed since 2014, and switched to working for KMB on a part-time basis last year. A memorial service for victims of the crash on Sunday. Photo: Apple Daily. The representatives added that Chan had been scheduled to work for four hours that day and there was no evidence that he was overly tired. Afterwards, a company spokesperson said that he was involved in a traffic accident in 2014 in Kwai Fong. He was convicted of careless driving, fined HK$900 and had points deducted from his record. According to Apple Daily, a pedestrian and a passenger sustained injuries in the accident, which occurred as he was driving a double-decker bus on route 46X. Representatives of KMB were present on Sunday morning at a roadside memorial for those who died in the accident. Speaking to reporters after the event, company chairman Norman Leung said KMB’s legal department will help those affected seek compensation from insurance companies and will dedicate HK$10 million to victims. The company previously said it would give HK$80,000 to each family unconditionally. Norman Leung. Photo: Screenshot/NowTV. But Leung walked away as reporters asked him why the company hired a driver with a previous conviction, and why the company previously said that the driver had a good record. Mr. Yip, whose uncle died in the accident, criticised KMB for being irresponsible in hiring a driver with a previous conviction: “Since there was a previous case, they should have seriously considered whether to hire him.” Asked whether he was angry at KMB, he said: “Everyone would be furious, if it was your own family member, the driver makes one turn and breaks up how many families?” “I hope KMB will be more careful in hiring from now on, and not be so frivolous.” Unions hit out Two KMB drivers’ unions have criticised the company for not taking its staff shortage seriously and hiring too many part-time drivers. KMB drivers’ union protest. Photo: InMedia. A KMB drivers’ union under the pro-democracy Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions marched to KMB headquarters with black armbands in protest. A spokesperson said that full time drivers are required to undergo 18 days of training, including eight days of driving routes, but part-time drivers are only required to undergo two days of route driving. Photo: InMedia. Another KMB drivers’ union under the pro-establishment Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions said that the company was hiring too many part-time drivers, describing the practice as a “time-bomb.”  In response to reports that the driver in the accident had argued with passengers, the union said that there was a staff shortage, and the company continues to increase route frequency. It asked passengers for their understanding as drivers face increasing pressure to stay on schedule. Correction 17.35: An early version of this article stated that the bus driver had a previous conviction of dangerous driving, as opposed to careless driving – a different charge. HKFP regrets the error.  Comments

Fireworks cancelled as victims mourned The Lunar New Year fireworks were called off by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor as the city mourns those who died in the Tai Po Bus accident, with flags flying at half-mast at government headquarters today. Civil servants are also keeping a minute's silence at 10am today following Saturday's bus accident that killed 19 passengers and sent 65 others to hospitals. The announcement was made by Lam at the Central Government Offices on Tamar Avenue yesterday. A massive fireworks display was planned for Victoria Harbour on Saturday night - one week after the bus accident. Lam said there was a general feeling in society to cancel the event and similar calls had been made by lawmakers across the political spectrum. "In order to pay respects to the deceased, and the victims, and also for the community to express their grief, it was not very appropriate to continue with the Chinese New Year fireworks," Lam said. She had gained support from the event's sponsor, Chevalier International Holdings. The corporation has also promised to make a donation of no less than HK$1 million to the victims of the accident, using funds saved from the canceled fireworks display, Lam said. The display's cost was estimated to be more than HK$8 million. Following the Lamma ferry accident on National Day 2012, the government canceled a fireworks display on National Day 2013. The ferry accident resulted in the death of 39 passengers. Lam also announced that the State Council had approved the decision to fly flags at half-mast at government headquarters today. High-ranking officials will avoid attending celebratory events in the coming week, she said. Lam said donations had increased to HK$42.5 million from HK$38 million on Sunday, with a new donation coming from the Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation. The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Law Chi-kwong, said the Social Welfare Department would open an account to collect donations from the public. But no date was given. Lam said she had met Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li about appointing a judge to head an independent committee to investigate the accident, as well as conduct a review of the franchise bus services in Hong Kong. Work has begun to establish the terms of reference of the committee and find a judge to head the committee, she said. Meanwhile, the Tai Po District Council had a special meeting yesterday to discuss the accident. Councillors and officials paid their respects with a minute of silence. KMB general manager Lee Chak-cheung apologized again for the accident, but shielded behind "legal proceedings" when asked how many KMB drivers had records of careless driving. "I don't want to add more explanations," he said. The police superintendent of the New Territories North Regional Headquarters, Chau Chung-mun, said there had been 29 traffic accidents at the crash site, in which 14 persons had been injured. Two of the accidents were serious. But he stressed that the road section was not a traffic black spot. Today's Standard

A 17-year-old student from Guangdong has been arrested after allegedly organising a chat room group that disseminated messages on the “Blue Whale” suicide game. According to US-backed Radio Free Europe, the Blue Whale Challenge is a “game” where teenage participants are ordered to perform one task every day – usually involving self-harm – ending with their suicides after 50 days. It reportedly originated on Russian social media networks, but there have been reports of the trend emerging around the world. Zhanjiang, Guangdong. Photo: Google Maps. The Beijing News reported that a teenage surnamed Xu, the founder of a chat group for buying and selling software and clothes, was detained for posts he made on WeChat related to the game on Friday. The high school student told Zhanjiang police that he was invited into a chat group named “Blue Whale suicide game” on May 9. He said he left the group after viewing materials related to the trend for around 10 minutes. The police said he then initially posted two messages related to the Blue Whale Challenge into his own group in order to attract a larger audience. The group soon expanded from 300 to 500 members. Xu admitted to posting photographs of self-mutilation that he downloaded from the internet into the group, said the police. “Congratulations to 11 members of the group for completing a mission from the Blue Whale Challenge,” police said he wrote. In the early hours of May 12, Xu was detained on suspicion of “spreading extremism.” The Zhanjiang police confirmed his detention on its WeChat public account on Tuesday. According to the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, the dissemination of terrorist or extremist materials is punishable by a prison term of less than five years in minor cases. Severe cases are punishable by a prison term of over five years. File photo: Pixabay. It is unclear whether any cases of self-harm or suicide in China or Hong Kong have been linked to the Blue Whale Challenge.

On Saturday, however, an anonymous writer on local student Facebook community Schools Secrets claimed that three friends were spotted with arm injuries a few days after they wrote the same cryptic Facebook posts: “#imawhale.” If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255.

Experts are urging parents and schools to keep a strong vigil on children after a sick social media game that has been linked to multiple teen suicides in Russia seems to have made its way into Hong Kong. The call for caution comes after a netizen who claimed to be a student of the University of Hong Kong said in a Facebook post that three of his friends were suspected to be participating in the Blue Whale Challenge, also known as the Blue Whale suicide game. According to the post, the three friends not only wrote “I am a whale” on their Facebook pages, but were also seen with their left hands wrapped in bandages a few days later, suggesting injuries. Expressing alarm, the netizen called on young people not to try the game, news website hk01.com reports. Blue Whale Challenge, which originated in Russia, is an online game in which participants are purportedly assigned a curator who suggests they commit various acts of self-harm on a daily basis for 50 days. It also goes by other names including “A Silent House”, “A Sea Of Whales” and “Wake Me Up At 4:20am”. On the final day, participants are urged to commit suicide so as to win the game, a sick challenge that has reportedly led to a number of young people ending up injured or dead around the world. The creator of the brain wash game, a 21-year-old Russian man named Philipp Budeikin, was arrested by police last year, but that has not put an end to the Blue Whale game in the cyber world. Professor Yip Siu-fai, director of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Center for Suicide and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, said he has been aware of the influences brought by the game. Besides calling on the government to be vigilant, Yip urged parents and schools to put up their guard and watch if those under their care suffer from any strange injuries or show behavioral changes. The game’s potential harmful consequences should not be underestimated, Yip said, warning youngsters not to even try the online game just out of curiosity. A senior social worker told Headline Daily that Blue Whale Challenge is a suicide-promoting endeavor rather than a just game, as the online challenge systematically asks players to hurt themselves. He asked all sections of society to stay on high alert to prevent the game from expanding online and prompting young people to form groups to commit suicide. - Contact us at [email protected] TL/AC/RC 
A 16-year-old secondary school student fell to his death in Tuen Mun around midnight on Tuesday, hk01.com reports. A passerby saw the boy lying unconscious on a container truck at Rose Dale Garden residential estate at 133 Castle Peak Road, and called the police. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Police found what is believed to be a suicide note beside the boy’s body; it said he hoped his parents would not blame him and that he had gone in search of the real meaning of life. Preliminary investigation showed that the boy fell from the building, hitting the truck’s container before bouncing into the gap behind the driving cabin. His parents did not know of his death until police officers knocked on their door. He was an only child. The boy was a secondary five student at CCC Tam Lee Lai Fun Memorial Secondary School, Apple Daily reported. Sources said he appeared to have a good relationship with his parents and had good grades at school. He had always been interested in science and innovative designs, and had wanted to be a scientist. He had invented a can opener for people with physical and motor problems, which had won him the top prize at a school invention competition. He also had numerous awards in other science and invention competitions, such as the Hong Kong Youth Science and Innovation Competition, a robot competition and the Soong Ching Ling Young Inventors Award. Tang Chi-kwong, assistant principal at his secondary school, said the boy had conducted himself normally during the first day of classes. Tang also said he did not believe that school could be a source of stress because the boy had always been a good student. The boy had a deformed left hand, but Tang said that did not seem to bother the boy at all. His teachers and classmates also did not notice anything unusual in his behavior prior to his death. Tang said the school would be in touch with the boy’s family and offer assistance. EJ Insight supports efforts to help people deal with depression and related issues.

My heart just aches whenever I hear news of students taking their own lives. According to the third report published earlier this year by the Review Panel of the Pilot Project on Child Fatality Review, between 2012 and 2013, a total of 206 child deaths were reported to the Coroner’s Court. And among the 75 deaths by unnatural causes, 20 of them were caused by suicides, with the youngest victim aged only 11. Among these 20 suicide cases, 14 victims had shown suicidal signs such as emotional volatility and violent behavior before they ended their own lives. The report concluded that many of these victims could actually have been prevented from killing themselves if their teachers or parents had been able to recognize their emotional problems sooner and seek professional help immediately. In fact, I cannot agree more with the conclusion of the report. I believe the key to preventing child and teen suicides is early detection and immediate intervention. And both teachers and parents can indeed play an important role in preventing tragedy by constantly monitoring the psychological state of their students and children, particularly during the first few weeks of the new school year and seeking immediate help from psychiatric professionals if need be. In the meantime, the government must devise solid plans and divert extra resources to support our schools and parents in their fight against student suicides. For example, over the years I have been calling upon the government to implement the so-called one-school-one-nurse policy in our schools, under which there would be at least one registered psychiatric nurse (RPN) stationed in every primary and secondary school across our city. The RPN in our schools would assume a leading role in identifying high-risk cases and providing professional assessment and support. And if necessary, the RPN can also refer students who need help to public mental health clinics run by the Hospital Authority (HA). Once teachers or parents have noticed any warning sign of suicide among students, they can immediately refer the case to the RPN in their schools, who can then intervene with them as soon as possible and provide proper and timely help before tragedy strikes. On the other hand, the RPN can also offer teachers and parents professional advice on how to meet the emotional needs of students and how to guide those who are struggling with emotional problems or stress-related depression. I learned that the Food and Health Bureau, the Education Bureau as well as the Social Welfare Department jointly launched the Student Mental Health Support Pilot Scheme last year, under which the HA sent two RPNs to each of the nine local schools that volunteered to take part in the scheme. And in April this year, the government further enhanced the scheme by sending an extra two senior RPNs to seven secondary and one primary schools. I welcome the government initiatives, but I also feel compelled to emphasize that in order to make sure the scheme will remain effective, viable and sustainable, the government must divert more manpower and resources into supporting it. On the other hand, since the introduction of the HKDSE (Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education), the average age of university freshmen in our city has dropped, calling into question their ability to manage study-related stress. I suggest that the one-school-one-nurse policy be extended to our tertiary institutions as well, under which university students can seek help from the RPNs directly through smartphone apps and social media. Apart from offering help and therapy, the government should also provide sufficient support for teachers and parents and equip them with the necessary know-how so that they can promote a positive outlook on life among our teenagers and help them build resilience.

By the Association Concerning the Legal Rights of Victims of Domestic Violence A murder-suicide case shocked Hong Kong last week. Last Monday, a man allegedly killed his wife at a luxury apartment building in Yau Ma Tei before taking his own life. The police said the husband had moved out of their home on Friday after the wife discovered he had been cheating and demanded a divorce. The Coronation in Yau Ma Tei. Photo: Wikicommons. Domestic violence in the city remains one of Hong Kong’s most neglected problems and unfortunately, also its most hidden. Yet, the media coverage of the murder-suicide case highlights a critical lack of understanding about the issue. As the horrific news about the young couple, who were both civil servants, gripped the city, reports speculated that the act of violence was the inevitable consequence of the wife earning a higher salary than the husband. The front-page story of Headline Daily on Tuesday, 5 September 2017, was titled: “Wife’s salary is more than double her husband’s. Wife in a higher position is a recipe for a tragedy.” News website HK01.com also linked the murder-suicide to the wife’s high salary. In a story published on 4 September, it quoted Szeto Hon-ming, a senior social worker, who said a wife shouldn’t “injure the pride” of the husband. He also advised wives who earned more than their husband not to use “terms that may undermine men’s self-esteem.” Today's Headline Daily: "Wife's salary is more than double her husband's. Wife being in a higher position is recipe for tragedy" ??? pic.twitter.com/oI0ydID6hB — Holmes Chan (@holmeschan_) September 6, 2017  Media ethics exact a higher standard of reporting than what is sadly on display from the headlines and stories which have emerged over the course of the week. The reports have irresponsibly showcased and perpetuated a sexist narrative which blames the victim. Although the homicide rate in Hong Kong remains comparatively low given the size of our population, the number of domestic murder-suicides among homicides features prominently. This is no cause for comfort but rather, calls for targeted approaches for prevention by frontline personnel who need to understand that such incidents are often the breaking point in a relationship likely to have been peppered by escalating violence earlier on. The majority of the victims are women, and the perpetrators are usually their partners or former partners. Hong Kong — along with Japan — has the highest rate of female homicide victims in the world: women comprise 52.9 per cent of the total homicide victims in these two jurisdictions, followed by South Korea at 52.5 per cent. Research shows that women are at a heightened risk of becoming victims of violence during periods of conflict in their relationship, particularly when they try to end their relationship. In a separate case also on Monday last week, a woman was raped by her estranged husband and his friend at her home in Sha Tin after she refused to reconcile with him. File photo: Pexels/freestocks.org. Domestic homicide, murder-suicide cases and other forms of intimate partner violence don’t happen in a vacuum. Multiple incidents of abuse occur before a woman is killed or harmed and before such instances come fully to light. Leaving a relationship is the most dangerous time for domestic violence victims. To lay blame on victims and labelling them as a “scorned wife” or “cold” for refusing to reconcile with a partner perpetuates patriarchy at the heart of which lies gender inequality and oppression. It is high time that Hong Kong acknowledges this reality as the root cause of violence against women. The media have the responsibility to report stories about violence against women in a manner that is fair and facilitates the public’s proper understanding of the issue and educates them on the complexities of such occurrences. As Mary Barry, chief executive of Our Watch, an Australian non-profit, recently said: “There is a clear link between media reporting and community attitudes towards violence against women.” Apart from journalists, we also call on those who work in the front line, from social workers to healthcare professionals to police, to have a deeper understanding about violence against women. This warrants regular, up-to-date training and development of skills to effectively handle complaints of violence and in particular, to offer follow-up services to prevent retaliation or escalation in the future. Sadly, these continue to be sorely lacking at this moment.

A well-known Chinese human rights lawyer died suddenly in hospital on Monday, according to Reuters. Li Baiguang, who had defended farmers and Christian pastors, died at the Number 81 People’s Liberation Army Hospital in Nanjing of liver failure, Reuters cited an unnamed source with direct knowledge of the case as saying. The source said efforts to save Li failed after a “sudden outbreak of illness,” but it was unknown whether there was an underlying, long-term issue as he had not completed a health check recently. Li Baiguang. File photo: VOA. Bob Fu, a US-based religious activist who was a close friend, has cast doubt on the circumstances of Li’s death, telling Reuters that it was highly unlikely for Li’s liver to fail overnight as he did not drink or smoke. ‘Full, independent, and transparent account’ According to Fu’s US-based NGO China Aid: “Li went to the hospital for a minor stomachache and was declared dead hours later. The hospital alleged that he had liver problems and that he bled to death, but Li was previously healthy.” Fu said in a China Aid statement that the Chinese government should be “held totally accountable” for his death, and called on the government to give a transparent account of the circumstances. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of China’s most courageous, pro-constitution lawyers,” said Fu. “He was treated violently last year and was threatened a number of times recently by the Chinese regime… The whole world should demand that the Chinese government give a full, independent, and transparent account on what caused Dr Li’s sudden death.” The NGO said in October that Li had been beaten and threatened with dismemberment while representing farmers in a land grab case against the municipal government. Li was given an award by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) – a US NGO largely funded by Congress – in 2008 for his work defending religious freedom. He worked with China Aid and often met with US officials. Li Baiguang (left). Photo: Bob Fu. In a statement on Tuesday, NED President Carl Gershman said “it is essential that an independent and impartial investigation into Li’s death be carried out.” US Senator Ben Cardin echoed the call for an investigation in a Tweet on Wednesday. The sudden death of #LiBaiguang is deeply concerning. China must engage in a full and transparent investigation immediately. This cannot be swept under the rug. https://t.co/ZUkUDuexf1 — Senator Ben Cardin (@SenatorCardin) February 26, 2018  Li had attended the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington D.C. weeks before his death alongside Fu and other Chinese activists, according to China Aid. Last year, Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo died at a hospital under police custody after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Dissident writer Yang Tongyan also passed away in November while on medical parole, after undergoing an operation to remove a brain tumour several months earlier. The NGO Chinese Human Rights Defenders said in its annual report released on Monday that the Chinese government’s ill-treatment of human rights defenders in custody may have directly contributed to the deaths of Liu and Yang. HKFP has contacted China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.  Comments

The death of a 24-year-old transgender woman in Tai Wai on Saturday has highlighted difficulties faced by transgender people in Hong Kong. The woman died after falling from an overhead bridge at Tai Wai MTR station. The incident took place at around 4:56pm, according to police. In multiple Facebook posts dating from 2015, the woman described her experience of gender dysphoria. She said that she felt like she was “born with the wrong gender.” In another post, the woman said that she felt like she was suffering because of an inability to “fit into society,” and in recent posts expressed a desire to “leave this world.” The incident took place at Tai Wai MTR Station. Photo: Googlemaps Gender dysphoria refers to a condition where one’s psychological and emotional identity as male or female is the opposite to one’s biological sex – though not all trans people experience the phenomena. Mental health Joanne Leung, chairperson of Transgender Resource Centre, told HKFP that there have been multiple cases of transgender people committing suicide over the last few years. According to a 2016 Chinese University policy brief commissioned by the Transgender Resource Center, 63.2 per cent of transgender people surveyed – and 70.4 per cent of those aged below 30- had contemplated suicide. 18.4 per cent of those surveyed answered that they had previously attempted suicide. The policy brief highlighted an “urgent” need for policy makers and service providers in Hong Kong “to address the mental health needs of transgender people, particularly those who are younger.” Photo: Daniel Garrett LGBTQ activist Billy Leung told HKFP: “The government needs to get its act together before another tragedy like this happens again.” Lack of legislation Following the landmark case of W, in which the city’s highest court ruled that a person who had undergone male-to-female gender confirmation surgery was allowed to marry a man, the government set up the Inter-departmental Working Group on Gender Recognition in 2014. The Working Group published Part 1 of its consultation paper on gender identity on 23 June, 2017. There remains no gender recognition law that addresses legal definitions regarding gender in Hong Kong. In January 2017, a group of organisations including the Pink Alliance, the Transgender Resource Center, The Association of World Citizens, and Beyond the Boundary issued a press release urging the government working group to set a definite timetable for its consultation paper and the establishment of a gender recognition law, and to consider the legal problems faced by intersex people . Photo: Press Release. “Disappointingly, the document lacks any clear direction on how to enact a gender recognition law,” Billy Leung said. In discussing the social exclusion experienced by transgender people in Hong Kong, Tommy Chen, a spokesperson from Rainbow Action, told HKFP that “members of the transgender community often have negative experiences when calling mainstream [mental health support] hotlines. Social workers on the receiving end often do not understand what is gender dysphoria, what it means to be transgender. They often hang up after saying that because they do not understand transgender issues.” The Transgender Resource Center has an online and telephone Counselling Service for those with concerns pertaining to gender orientation and identity. The Association for Transgender Rights has a hotline on 62168026 or 97914641. If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255.

Rape-bid student found hanged A top Secondary Four student at an elite Kwun Tong school accused of attempted rape was found hanged in the drainage room of a Sau Mau Ping housing estate yesterday. Police were closing in on the 17-year- old student of a Band-One school about 5am yesterday when they found him dead in Po Tat Estate.  Police suspect he hanged himself  using his backpack strings. Police said a wound on the hand of the boy, identified as Doing To Cheuk- wing, matched the one made by the victim when she was attacked early on Saturday. Police also said a reusable bag found in the boy's backpack may also be related to the case. "We found in the deceased's room a T-shirt and the shorts the suspect was said to have worn when attempting to rape the woman, and there is a bite on the back of his right hand, which matched the wound the victim made on the suspect when struggling," Sau Mau Ping District acting superintendent Yin Hiu-yu said. Yin said there was no suicide note at the scene but there was nothing suspicious about To's death. Police have so far not been able to contact To's family and Yin said they may not be in Hong Kong. The Kowloon East regional crime unit is handling the case. At 2am on Saturday, a 19-year-old was returning to her Tin Wan House home in Shun Tin Estate after jogging along Shun On Road when she was attacked from behind, dragged and had her head covered with a reusable bag. She screamed, struggled and bit the attacker's hand, forcing him to flee. Police classified the case as attempted rape and said they were looking for a 1.7-meter tall suspect who wore glasses and was wearing a dark- colored T-shirt and shorts and was aged about 20. To was a top student in a Band-One secondary school. One of his schoolmates said that while he was silent and an introvert, he had good academic results. The schoolmate said it was hard to believe that To was involved in an attempted rape case. A schoolmate who studied with him in Sau Mau Ping Catholic Primary School said To was seriously sick for several months and had to repeat one school year, making him older than his classmates. It was believed that To lived with his mother and younger brother in Po Tat Estate and that the mother worked as a waitress in a restaurant in the estate. To's younger brother studies in the same school and also had outstanding results in both Secondary Two and Secondary Three. It was said that his mother and younger brother had recently gone to the mainland. Kwun Tong District councilor Mok Kin-shing, elected from the Shun Tin constituency, said the attempted rape occurred at a quiet spot of the estate. Mok said he could not conclude from individual events that public security had worsened but there must be room to improve security. "I will also suggest to the Housing Authority to add more surveillance cameras within the estate," he said. The estate was also the scene of a flasher but there have been no sightings in recent months, he said. Today's Standard

Let me begin with a confession: Chris Patten has had an important influence on my life, though I doubt he remembers. As a 16-year-old, unsure of where and what degree to study, he offered me some advice. “I read history,” he told me. “I recommend it. It’s a good degree to do.” Chris Patten. Patten was again in Hong Kong earlier this week. He was here to promote his new book, appropriately titled First Confession. I read it in August, having ordered a copy online. Patten was not here to disturb the waters, as some commentators have suggested. In fact, since leaving in 1997, the last governor has wisely not visited Hong Kong on his own initiative. Every visit has been by invitation, or as part of a book tour. He has also, characteristically, not been afraid to speak his mind. But only when asked, and only on issues that are already being debated in Hong Kong. His answers are hardly provocative. See also: Hong Kong leaders will ‘always need to stand up to Beijing’, says city’s last governor Chris Patten During his short stay he would have heard former Secretary for Education and Manpower Arthur Li call Hong Kong students “losers” unable to compete with their Mainland counterparts. He would also have heard Junius Ho, the former president of the Law Society and now a pro-establishment legislator representing New Territories West, publicly call for the “extermination” of people who advocate independence, post online comments in support of this, and describe such action as being equivalent to “killing pigs and dogs.” I use the term “exterminate” rather than “kill without mercy” as was first translated. Ho now says whilst those pro-establishment voices with whom he shared a stage had indeed called for them to be killed, he had not used that term. To exterminate is apparently better. Junius Ho. Photo: Facebook/Junius Ho. During these same few days Patten may well have noted how those students who had supposedly advocated separatism by plastering on the student union notice boards at several university campuses a poster that read “Independent Hong Kong” did not actually do anything  more to cause offence. They and the student unions were however still grilled by the press for past antics. And let’s not forget how this started: with a Mainland student caught on camera tearing down posters as she found the idea offensive. The poor girl was then subjected to hate mail, but also hailed on the Mainland as a “heroine” and “patriot”. If dealt with from an academic perspective, the central issue is not separatism but freedom of expression. Should a university campus be a “free space” where students are sheltered from positions they may find offensive? And why exactly is a poster stating Hong Kong independence offensive, especially to someone for whom Hong Kong is not home? Surely the very point of a university education is to develop in students critical skills necessary to think rationally and logically, and to formulate and amend a position. It is therefore central to education that students are challenged, and learn to look constructively on positions and issues that they may find disagreeable or even uncomfortable. Tertiary education — an education of mature minds — that is merely one-way learning is not learning, as critical faculties are not developed. It is indoctrination. Patten’s sense of irony would no doubt have been alerted to the example of our university heads’ attempt to depoliticise the situation by taking a political stance in stating that the idea of independence is not only contrary to one-country, two system, which by definition it is; but also that it is illegal — which it is not. File photo: In-Media. In fact, to make an idea illegal would be a violation of both the Basic Law and of Hong Kong’s commitments under international law as a ratified member of the ICCPR. And yet, as Patten no doubt knew but had the good manners not to point out directly, the official response has been consistent and predictable since 2014: to see fault only with one side; and to demonise Hong Kong’s youth. South China Morning Post editor Yonden Lhatoo’s weekend column of the 9th September was entitled When did Hong Kong’s youth lose their basic humanity?  The reason for this sweeping condemnation of young people was the posting of 12 sheets of paper at one university campus that congratulated Undersecretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin for the loss of her 25-year-old son, who had recently committed suicide. The message was certainly vile, and was rightly condemned by Chief Executive Carrie Lam as “entirely disrespectful, against the moral values of society and cold-blooded.” However no Hong Kong student body supported the message, let alone claimed responsibility, and yet both directly and by implication Hong Kong youth are blamed. I chose this example not because I dislike Lhatoo or the SCMP, but because it illustrates a more general point. Similar and worse comments are carried in most of the local pro—establishment press, which has become in effect every print paper other than Apple Daily. It is also a piece I know caused ire among many teachers and university lecturers, who wrote in en masse with another story to tell, but found the paper unwilling to publish their comments. This lack of diversity of opinion, and the systematic shutting down of opposition voices in traditional media platforms, will be new to Patten, who presided over a genuinely free and flourishing press. A student sticking anti-independence posters on the campus Democracy Wall. Photo: Facebook screenshot. Now consider how Patten, as Chancellor of Oxford University, handled the similarly contentious issue of Scottish independence. Patten told reporters at the FCC, “[students] were free to discuss Scottish independence, though I told them why it would not be a good idea.” Central to any institution that respects freedom of speech is Voltaire’s maxim, that I may disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. Can it honestly be said that Hong Kong today is a society that stands by this? So what advice had our last governor to give? What might our new Chief Executive and her administration do to help heal the divisions that have both radicalised Hong Kong politics and poisoned our communities? Patten’s advice is both straight forward and simple. Firstly, Patten calls on the opposition in Hong Kong to refocus, to veer away from the tribal politics of localism and focus again on what was in principle agreed on in the Basic Law: greater democracy in Hong Kong. Second, and more important, was his call for the SAR government to listen to and engage with the opposition. Praising new Chief Executive Carrie Lam as a “good communicator,” he said: If you want to unite the community, you have to be part of the dialogue about the community’s concerns, which obviously include social issues but also include politics. This is to engage not with the dishonesty peddled at times by both sides, but with the arguments based on facts. However, just knowing the facts has sadly become a battle in itself — a battle readily at play in the way Patten’s own words were distorted. Patten made clear that whilst he did not think Hong Kong’s courts were politically pressured in either process of the law or in ruling, he did consider the decision by Justice Minister Rimsky Yuen to act against the advice of his own legal counsel and reopen the case against Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow was political. Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow. File photo: In-Media. He also called on Beijing not to see the debate about democracy in Hong Kong as an act of subversion. He said Hong Kong people should not be seen as dissidents, and that the city “was not out to cause trouble.” Now this was how China Daily heard it: By calling Wong the best thing that has happened to Hong Kong and ever will, he practically accused the city’s judiciary of political prosecution. Not only is this a non-sequitur, Patten even clearly and repeatedly stated that he continued to believe in the independence of the judiciary. To quote him just once: I don’t think the judiciary is being politicised. I don’t think the judiciary does whatever the government tells it to do. And it’s not just the paper no one actually reads that has developed this bad habit. Here is the editors note to a column in the South China Morning Post: A dignified silence is advised for the last governor of Hong Kong, whose criticism of the decision to jail Occupy activists was seen as an attack on the judiciary and rule of law. The column by Alex Lo then highlights that other increasingly common problem: a lack of argument. Indeed, in this case an argument is not even bothered with at all, the implication being that none is necessary. It gives the impression to readers that judgement has already been passed, and that the Hong Kong community are in agreement. He writes: Patten did reiterate that he does not support “Hong Kong independence” but he still managed to excuse the separatists. He implied that they would not have gone down their suicidal path if the central government had given them a chance to run for high government office. Remove the words “still managed” and the quote would not only be accurate but a perfectly reasonable statement. Here is are two further examples:  In a speech this week, he advised university heads to talk to their student activists. He said people should pursue democracy but not independence. Such pearls of wisdom! [Of using the term dissident as] a condescending label Western hypocrites like him habitually put on anyone when they want to justify their meddling in other sovereign states’ domestic affairs. One example is taken from China Daily and the other from South China Morning Post. Both are vindictive, mean spirited and personal. Neither make an argument. What Patten has said should not come as a surprise to anyone. His position on the recently concluded legal case against the three student leaders is actually that of the pan-democratic parties, as is his position on the independence posters on student union noticeboards and, before, on the six newly elected pro-democracy lawmakers who were forced to vacate their seats for improperly swearing their oath of office. It would not surprise me, even with the mainstream media turning the screw, if Patten’s position on all three of these issues were that shared by the majority of Hong Kong people. This is not because Patten has a good feel for how the people think — it is because his position seems to me to be the most obviously reasonable. Chris Patten. Photo: Tom Grundy/HKFP. Twenty years ago Patten’s set an example to a young school boy of how to listen carefully, and to receive questions with consideration and respect, and often too with a touch of humour. When berated, he did not resort to personal abuse. This was an educated man in command of his intellect. Used to an unquestioning and paternal civil service, and gentlemanly diplomat-governors who usually worked behind the scenes, here was a new style of governor: a man of humble upbringings who did good; and a man of the hustings, who understood that moral if not legal authority lay not with the state but with the people. And so I took his advice. It proved to be a good decision. But today the real question Hong Kong need to know is not what will Carrie Lam do, but whether she has a choice at all.

A Chinese nanny with heavy gambling debts was sentenced to death Friday for setting a fire that killed her employer’s wife and children in a tragedy which grabbed national attention and raised questions over official handling of the case. A court in the eastern city of Hangzhou found Mo Huanjing, a nanny for a family of five, guilty of arson in the fire that killed a mother and her three children on June 22 last year, and sentenced her to death. Mo Huanjing. The case went viral in China due to the tragic circumstances and reported delays in the firefighting response, with Friday’s court announcement among the top-trending items on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform, with tens of millions of “reads”. The Weibo hashtag “Wife and kids in heaven June 22” by 37-year-old Lin Shengbin, who was away when the fire occurred, has generated nearly 1.3 billion “reads” since the tragedy first occurred. Mo, 35, was allegedly a obsessive gambler who borrowed and also stole money from the family as her debts mounted. The court said Mo admitted to starting a fire in the living room of the family’s 18th-floor high-rise apartment in Hangzhou, planning to put it out quickly to play the hero and use the resulting goodwill to seek more money from her employers. But the fire rapidly raged out of control and Mo escaped, leaving behind Lin’s 34-year-old wife Zhu Xiaozhen and three children aged six, nine, and 11 years, who all died of asphyxiation. Lin has gained 2.3 million Weibo followers since he opened an account to document his efforts to seek justice. “The devil has finally received the punishment of the law, the death penalty,” Lin said in a post on Friday. “I have suffered day and night for the past 200 days, and today finally received the verdict.” Lin said he planned to pursue civil cases against other “powerful” parties who he blames for the deaths. He did not offer specific details, but has previously blamed Greentown, the builder of the high-rise and a major listed property developer, saying poor safety features in the apartment complex contributed to a delayed fire-fighting response. The fire department last year denied accusations that it was slow to respond, instead blaming low water pressure and a lack of required fire safety features in the building. China regularly sees deadly fire disasters, often blamed on the lax enforcement or flouting of fire safety rules.  Comments

[This article contains images some readers may find distressing] A Hong Kong kindergarten attended by a five-year-old who reportedly died after being found unconscious at home was aware of multiple bruises suffered by the girl months before her tragic death, according to photos taken by teachers and obtained by FactWire. Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said in a press release on 10 January that it had opened an investigation to look into the case. Photo: Factwire. On 6 January, Chan Sui-lam was rushed to hospital covered in bruises but was declared dead on arrival. Her 26-year-old father and 27-year-old stepmother were arrested and subsequently charged with murder two days later. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. Vivian Yu Mei-ying, principal of Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery in Tuen Mun, told reporters at the time that the kindergarten did not find any injuries on the girl before Sui-lam quit the school in late October. Vivian Yu Mei-ying, principal of Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery in Tuen Mun, did not respond to any questions from reporters. Photo: Factwire. However, dozens of images obtained by FactWire have raised questions over that claim and whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy. The two sets of photos, including 19 images taken on 5 September and seven on 25 September, show a number of bruises all over her body, including on both of her arms, hands, legs and feet. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. The first set of photos includes one showing a badly swollen right palm, while photos in the second set show bruise marks across her right cheek and a scabbed wound on her left. Multiple sources have verified the photos and confirmed they were taken by teachers at the kindergarten. One whistleblower told FactWire that Yu, the principal, explicitly told teachers to photograph the bruises when they were first spotted. The source added that teachers had later submitted a report, which was signed by Yu and accompanied with photographs, documenting the details of Sui-lam’s injuries found on 5 and 25 September. Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said in a press release on 10 January that it had opened an investigation to look into the case. Photo: Factwire. Injuries found on other occasions, include red marks and peeling skin on her ear, were not included in the report, said another source. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. Sui-lam had stopped attending school on 27 October and was officially withdrawn from the kindergarten in December. Her case was also reported to the preschool’s supervisor around that time, according to a source close to the operator Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. But speaking to reporters two days after her death, Yu insisted the school had found no injuries on the girl and therefore never filed any injury report with the Education Bureau nor the Social Welfare Department. She added that teachers would have noticed the bruises because pupils were wearing short-sleeve uniforms in September. Chan Sui-lam. Photo: Factwire. Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said in a press release on 10 January that it took allegations that the school was previously alerted of the situation very seriously and had opened an investigation to look into the matter. ‘The service has promised it would invite the relevant departments and independent parties to join in the investigation whenever appropriate,’ the statement said. The organisation has yet to release findings from its internal probe. Yu has just returned to work last Wednesday after taking a leave of absence after the incident. She did not respond to any questions about Sui-lam’s case at the kindergarten yesterday. The Reverend Daniel Li Yat-shing, the kindergarten’s supervisor and first vice-president of the Lutheran Church Hong Kong Synod, also declined to comment on whether the church knew about the injuries before the girl’s death, citing ongoing legal proceedings. The Reverend Daniel Li Yat-shing, the preschool’s supervisor and first vice president of theLutheran Church Hong Kong Synod, declined to comment, citing ongoing legal proceedings. Photo: Factwire. In an email response on Tuesday morning, a spokesperson for Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said: ‘The service would like to express our sorrow and sympathy at the passing of a pupil from Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery. We have collected information about her situation at school before her death and have handed that information to the police. ‘Based on legal advice, we would not take any actions that may affect the ongoing court proceedings.’ Photos taken by teachers on September 5 show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. The church currently runs 12 kindergartens and nurseries, six primary schools, 13 secondary schools, two special schools, two international schools and one seminary across Hong Kong, with a total of near 20,000 students. Photos taken by teachers on September 5 show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. The girl’s father Chan Hoi-ping, 26, and stepmother Wong Hiu-tung, 27, have been in custody on a murder charge since 8 January. Photos taken by teachers on September 5 show Sui-lam’s bruises.

Poor life planning is a reason students take their own lives, the Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim said on Friday. His comments were based on a report from the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides which will be submitted to the Education Bureau at the end of the month. “The subjects that students picked at university might not have been what they were interested in, or what they were good at,” Ng said. “That is why good life planning is important.” Secretary for Education Eddie Ng. File Photo: Stand News. The committee was set up in March after seven student suicide cases emerged in the space of just nine days.

Suicide-bid son has mental issues A former social worker who allegedly killed his mother before attempting suicide may have been suffering from depression, sources said. Police found psychiatric drugs when they searched through the flat at Kwai Shing East Estate in Kwai Chung where the 77-year-old woman was found dead on Sunday. Sources said the suspect, surnamed  Lee, 34, had been a patient at Kwai Chung Hospital's West Kowloon Psychiatric Centre and was last seen by a doctor late last month.  At the last appointment, Lee was given the all-clear and was due for reassessment in February, sources said. It is understood police have requested Lee's medical files from the Hospital Authority.  Lee is alleged to have almost beheaded his mother, a patient with chronic health issues.  According to neighbors, Lee was her caregiver and had complained about stress and the lack of supportive services. Two domestic workers were employed by the family to care for the patient but were on leave on Sunday, police said. Around noon, Lee jumped from the flat on the 16th floor but his fall was broken by a tree and he remained conscious. He was rushed to Princess Margaret Hospital with serious injuries. Doctors deemed he was unfit for questioning yesterday, and it is understood that police have not yet taken his statement. Sources said officers are also looking into Lee's financial records. Lee and his friend co-founded an estate management company in 2011, but he was not able to work full-time as he had to care for his sick mother. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said the family had never applied for long-term care or "aging in place" services, according to Social Welfare Department records. "In my understanding, the old lady was taken care of by two foreign domestic helpers, but still the incident happened, so it's not clear whether the problem was inadequate support in care  we must learn the lesson and see what needs improving," he said. Cheung said he was saddened by the incident and the government will try to provide better support to caregivers in the hope of relieving stress. He said the government will provide more elderly home places and day-care quotas, so as to meet the demand of an aging population. He also said the government will improve its residential respite service that allows an elderly person in need of care to be taken into a home for a few days to give the caregiver a rest and relieve stress. Kwai Tsing District Council member Rayman Chow Wai-hung said he had known Lee for years, and that he had vented dissatisfaction with the government's elderly-care services before. Speaking on a radio program, Chow said Lee was an able problem-solver and he was shocked to learn about the incident.  He also said Lee told him his mother disliked elderly homes. Today's Standard

A student who tore down Hong Kong independence posters at the Chinese University (CUHK) has been praised by Communist Party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. The appearance of signs advocating separatism at several local universities – and some school authorities’ attempts to ban them – has led to controversy and a debate about free speech on campus in recent days. On Tuesday, a video by SocRec showed a student who attempted to take down Hong Kong independence posters being confronted by student union members. It was widely viewed and disseminated online. As a result, the mainland student has been both celebrated and condemned.  In a column focused on Hong Kong in the People’s Daily’s overseas edition, writer Zhang Qingbo supported her act. “In recent days ‘Hong Kong independence’ members have been creating chaos, so some students came out to tear down their posters, and started ‘we refuse to be represented’ actions on social media – these self-motivated acts of justice are worthy of praise and encouragement.” He claimed that unions were not representative of all students, citing declining turnout numbers during elections. He claimed that student unions were linked to pro-independence figures, and were acting as the “pawns” of these figures. “This is why, whenever they do things, there are always students emphasising that ‘the student union does not represent me,'” he said, referring to “CUSU is not CU” posters that appeared on the “Democracy Wall” managed by the student union. ‘Cyber violence’  In an interview with mainland news aggregator Guancha, the student declined to give her name, only revealing that she was from northern China, and saying she was afraid that other students would be able to find her. She said that she became a victim of “cyber violence” on Facebook and received threats. But later on Thursday, she asked the news site to publish a statement from her. She wrote that she felt sad after reading the comments below the posts from Hong Kong media, but after receiving support from Guancha readers, “I know that there is a strong motherland behind me, so no matter what, I should not feel afraid.” Photo: Screenshot/SocRec. She claimed that the posters which were put up were against the rules, and should have been taken down. She added that she was proud of her actions, that she loved CUHK, and asked for privacy so she could concentrate on her studies. The Weibo account of the Communist Youth League also posted in her support on Thursday. Comments beneath the post expressed their support, with some praising the student for her bravery. Many also praised her for her English skills, and denigrated those of the female CUSU representative confronting her. One screenshot of a Weibo comment taken by Guancha said: “Hong Kong separatists are extolling freedom and democracy on one hand, but on the other they are forcibly interfering with other people’s freedom of speech – isn’t this slapping their own mouths? Didn’t think that Hong Kong universities had been reduced to this – give a like to this brave girl.” Below the video posted on Facebook by SocRec, commenters attacked the student, saying she had no right to tear down the posters, and that her actions could constitute criminal damage. Some swore and told her to “go back to China” while others said her English was terrible and that she did not understand democracy. “If you think they don’t have any right to put thing on the wall, so why did you think you have the right to tears [sic] off something? Are you fucking idiots or just a bitch!” one comment that received over a hundred likes said.  Comments

Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said that her government will set up an independent commission of inquiry chaired by a judge to investigate Saturday’s bus crash in Tai Po that left 19 dead and dozens injured. A KMB double-decker crashed and rolled on to its side on Tai Po Road shortly after 6pm. The driver was arrested for dangerous driving causing death and injury, though the reason for the crash remains unclear. Photo: HKFP. “I have decided to set up an independent [commission] of inquiry, led by a judge, to make sure that Hong Kong’s public transport system – especially public buses – can become safe and reliable,” Lam told reporters on Saturday night. “If the independent inquiry reveals certain structural problems or other problems, I hope they will give us some recommendations.” Commissions of Inquiry are given special powers to investigate materials and summon witnesses over matters of public importance. They have previously been established to probe scandals such as the 2015 discovery of excess lead in drinking water, and accidents such as the 2012 Lamma Island ferry disaster. “[The government will allocate] a specific social worker to care for every affected family,” added Lam. “I wouldn’t want to force families to go around asking different government departments or civil servants for help while they are so troubled and worried.” Carrie Lam. File photo: InMedia. The death toll rose from 18 to 19 at 4am on Sunday morning after one man died from his injuries at United Christian Hospital, reported RTHK.  KMB has apologised on its Facebook page and changed its profile photo to a black logo: “KMB expresses extreme regret and sadness at this accident, and deeply apologises.” It said that the driver was employed in 2014, and had been involved in another accident that August. The firm will provide HK$80,000 to support affected families and assist with insurance claims Last September, three people were killed and 31 injured after a Citybus double-decker mounted a kerb in Sham Shui Po. In 2003, 21 died and 20 were injured when a KMB double-decker ploughed through a guardrail and down a hill off Tuen Mun Road after colliding with a truck. Police have set up a casualty hotline 1878 999 for the public to make enquiries about those injured.   Comments

Activist admits mocking Choi after son's death A pro-independence activist has admitted putting up a notice at City University mocking Undersecretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin after she lost her son. It came a day after a notice "congratulated" Choi on her son "going to heaven" was posted at Education University. Choi's eldest son, Peter Poon Hong-  yang, 25, died on Thursday after jumping from the family's flat on the 41st floor of the luxury estate Sorrento in Austin Road West. Poon had been treated for depression after a serious cycling accident while competing in a triathlon. On the day of Poon's death, two men put up a poster at Education University in Tai Po.  Their action was caught by a campus security camera. Footage showing the pair grinning after putting up the poster was leaked to media. It was unclear if they were students of Education University. There was a copycat incident at City University on Friday - and the action was claimed by pro-independence activist Tsoi Pui- keung. Tsoi, 23, dared authorities to "arrest him quickly" after a video surfaced online showing him putting up a notice on a bulletin board that says "congratulations to Christine Choi for the joy of losing her son."  He wrote on his Facebook page yesterday: "I want to know which law I broke."  Tsoi, a former City University student, was arrested last year for threatening Alan Lo Ying-ki, a returning officer of the Registration and Electoral Office, after Hong Kong National Party convener Chan Ho-tin was barred from being nominated to run for the Legislative Council election. Meanwhile, a group of principals warned Education University it will never hire its graduates, a student union leader said. Citing what transpired at a meeting with the university's administrators, Education University of Hong Kong Students' Union president Lala Lai Hiu- ching said on Friday that some principals made the "no hiring" vow. Lai said the university also reported that a number of students had their internships suspended after the incident. Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said the bureau has not been informed of such arrangement but added principals were "concerned" with the situation. Meanwhile, an online petition that claims to have been signed by more than 500 principals and more than 1,000 teachers was sent to Education University on Saturday. Invitations were sent out to teachers via e-mail.  Today's Standard

Frederick Ma, the council chair of the Education University, has urged lawmakers not to put further pressure on students over a recent controversy at the teacher training school. The university recently faced an outcry over malicious slogans posted on its message board. CCTV footage leaked to media showed two men putting up pieces of paper on the campus’s message board “congratulating” Education Undersecretary Choi Yuk-lin for the death of her son. Another slogan mocked the late Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. The identities of those who put up the posters are still unknown. Frederick Ma. Photo: RTHK screenshot. Pro-Beijing lawmaker Ben Chan launched a petition last week urging the school to review its surveillance camera footage and remove them from the school. But in response, Ma urged all sides to stop putting pressure on students. “I ask you all, for the sake of our society, for the sake of our next generation, don’t do this,” he said on a Commercial Radio programme. “Politics is politics, education is education,” he added. Signs saying “Congratulations Choi Yuk-lin on the death of your son” appeared on top of other signs protesting the removal of banners advocating independence on Education University’s Democracy Wall. Photo: Chung Kim Wah/Facebook. He also said that, even if those responsible for the posters were students at the university, their actions did not represent the entire school. “The people trained by this school are mostly teachers. If we get a lot of politics at the university, or [the incident] affects its reputation, it is not good for Hong Kong,” he said. “I do hope this incident will soon pass.” Student Union President Lai Hiu-ching said she heard from top school officials that some schools said they will not employ Education University graduates, and internship opportunities for around ten students had been withdrawn. Education University Vice-Chancellor Stephen Cheung did not give a straight answer when asked whether such incidents had occurred. Vice-chancellor of Education University Stephen Cheung. Photo: RTHK screenshot. He said he hoped the public could give the school some time to handle the situation, whilst it has yet to be confirmed whether the people involved were students at the school. “I hope everyone will not ‘make a judgment before the trial,'” he said. He said the police will not be involved in identifying those involved. He added that if they were the university’s students, they will be protected and given space to give the school an explanation of their actions. “I will respect their identities – we will not reveal them,” he said. A banner mocking Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia. Photo: Screenshot. Cheung said the school did not intentionally leak the footage, and it has asked the privacy commissioner to investigate. Union President Lai said the school has the responsibility to protect personal privacy and she hoped the school will reveal relevant information after the privacy commissioner has completed an investigation.

A poster mocking the death of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has appeared on the campus of the Education University, two days after a similar poster mocking the death of a local official’s son was widely condemned and removed. Written in simplified Chinese, the apparently satirical poster on the Democracy Wall read: “Congratulations to Liu Bandit Xiaobo on going west, congratulations to [his wife] Liu Xia on being forever house-imprisoned by our party.” The banner mocking Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia. Photo: Screenshot. The Education University said on Saturday morning that it strongly condemned the poster, and has removed it in accordance with policy owing to its offensive nature. Poster row The row over posters began after banners supporting Hong Kong independence were displayed and then taken down at the Chinese University of Hong Kong earlier in the week. Competing messages soon began appearing on the symbolic Democracy Wall with those who supported, and those who opposed, independence vying for space. Arguments then broke out between Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking students. See also: Student who tore down pro-independence posters abused online in Hong Kong, but wins praise in state media As news broke that the son of the pro-Beijing education undersecretary Choi Yuk-lin had fallen from his apartment on Thursday, a poster “congratulating” Choi on his death appeared on the Democracy Wall of Education University. That evening, Education University vice-chancellor Stephen Cheung told TVB that he would investigate CCTV footage to determine whether the perpetrators were students or outsiders. “If they were outsiders, we we’ll put them online to tell everyone that it’s these two men who did such shocking things,” he added. Vice-chancellor of Education University Stephen Cheung. Photo: i-Cable screenshot. The student union of Education University released a statement that evening condemning the leak of the screenshots to the media. “[The school] has brought hot-headed Cultural Revolution-style public criticisms – so prevalent in Hong Kong in recent years – onto campus,” it read. Different attitudes Student union President Lai Hiu-ching said the Liu Xiaobo poster was of similar wording to the poster on Choi’s son, but the school had adopted different attitudes for the two incidents. Vice-chancellor Stephen Cheung did not specifically hold a press conference in person to condemn the Liu Xiaobo poster, unlike when handling the poster on Choi’s son. Lai said it would make the public consider whether the different attitudes were because of the different political backgrounds of the incidents. “Clearly the levels of condemnation were different,” she said. Lai also said she heard from top school officials at a meeting on the incidents that some schools had said they will not employ Education University graduates, and internship opportunities for around ten students were cancelled. Lai said such actions would seriously affect students and she hoped the public should not make condemnations before the identities of people who pasted the posters were confirmed. “Even if the posters were pasted up by Education University students, what does it have to do with other students?” she said. Education secretary Kevin Yeung said he has not heard such news. Photo: Apple Daily. The three people later stopped by security staffers, who suspected the person was not a student. They called the police, but no arrests have been made.  Comments

Yip Siu-fai, head of a newly set-up committee on prevention of student suicides, says that society lacks understanding of mental health issues, and that they are looking into whether individuals had refused to seek help due to the stigma. The committee was established in March by the Education Bureau, in response to the series of suicides by students earlier this year. Yip is the Director of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong. Members of the committee include school, parent, youth and student representatives, social workers and healthcare professionals, as well as government officials. Yip Siu-fai, chair of the committee. File Photo: Apple Daily. On an RTHK programme on Monday, Yip said, “I don’t think it’s that people don’t attach enough importance to [the issue of student suicides] – it’s that everyone lacks knowledge and understanding of mental health issues. We hope to improve their understanding, education and research, and to do more work for those in need of help.” Yip also said that the committee had analysed 34 cases of student suicides over the past three years and found that 20 per cent were receiving mental healthcare. However, in western countries, 80 per cent of those who commit suicide had already been diagnosed as having mental illnesses before their deaths, RTHK reported. Primary school students. File Photo: Apple Daily. Yip added that the the committee was concerned about whether there was a shortage in Hong Kong of relevant services, or the problem was that the individual at risk refuses to receive treatment due to stigma. The committee submitted a report on their findings to the government earlier. One of the suggestions involve sending senior nurses with training in psychiatry to some schools in order to support students in need. Yip said he hoped this would help teachers who may not know how to deal with such issues. The committee also found that pressure from schoolwork was often an indirect cause of suicides, but more often it was that students did not have a good relationship with their family, and were being forced to study instead of building on their own interests.

The eldest son of Education Undersecretary Choi Yuk-lin has died after falling from a Tsim Sha Tsui flat on Thursday morning. Around 11:50am, 25-year-old Poon Hong-yan fell from The Sorrento on Austin Road and was found lying on the podium of the estate’s Block 3. He was taken to hospital by an ambulance, but was later pronounced dead. The reasons for the incident are still unknown. Choi Yuk-lin. File Photo: Stand News. Choi’s press secretary told local media that Choi thanks the public for its concern and she wishes to be given space through the difficult time. Choi had two sons. RTHK cited anonymous sources as saying that the flat was Choi’s family residence, and that the eldest son had a record of depression and did not leave a suicide note. The public broadcaster reported that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. Education Secretary Kevin Yeung said in a statement that he was saddened by the incident and expressed his deepest sympathy to the undersecretary and her family on behalf of the Education Bureau. Yeung added that he will fully support Choi. The Sorrento. Photo: Wikimedia Commons. Choi was appointed education undersecretary in July despite controversy over her pro-Beijing political stance.

Christine Choi's son falls to his death The eldest son of the undersecretary for education, Christine Choi Yuk-lin, died today  after falling from his home at a residential complex above Kowloon MTR Station.  
Peter Poon was 25. He was a physiotherapist at North District Hospital 
At about 11:00am, a security guard at The Sorrento, above the  Kowloon MTR station, found the youth lying on the ninth floor concourse.  
Paramedics rushed him to Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he was certified dead.  
Choi, (pictured, center), later issued a statement asking for her and her family to be given some space following the tragedy. Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung also issued a statement expressing his condolences. 
Local media reports say a domestic helper had tried to stop Choi's son, who suffered from depression, from killing himself but he locked himself in a room. 
He was found to have fallen from the building some time later. 
Choi became Under Secretary for Education last month. - RTHK/The Standard Today's Standard

HK Psychologists Concern has come out in support of the Education Bureau’s “no-suicide contracts” amid debate online. A copy of the contract – which have been made available by the bureau to schools since 2011 – was widely circulated on the internet on Monday night. The document came from an eBook published by the Education Bureau aimed at preventing student suicide. The English version was last updated in October 2015. The professional concern group said that contracts are a “commonly used and effective method” for therapy sessions. “The hope is that through the process of writing the contract, its contents will be highlighted and actualised,” it said. The process of building the contract includes listing out persons to call and methods that are effective in reducing anxiety. It also asks the student to list a person that “cares deeply” about them and “does not want me to harm myself.” No-suicide contract. Photo: Gov HK. The contract could be helpful for students who may be in a confused state, as it would “increase [the] chances of them remembering ways to help themselves when they are tempted to commit suicide,” it added. It urged netizens to stop criticising the contract so that students who seek help will not lose confidence in the contract. However, Cheng Lap, a former teacher, said on Facebook that “this [contract] is being talked about now because society has worsened to such a bad state. What reason do we have to continue to say that this kind of contract, because it is used by social workers, is effective and cannot be criticised? That if there wasn’t such a contract more people would commit suicide?” Photo: Apple Daily. Chow Tsz-yan, a teacher and student guidance officer, told Stand News: “I understand that this tool is not necessarily useful, and there is controversy between [different] schools of thoughts. But according to experience, in cases where a relationship has already been established with the student, it is a fairly effective shield and can function as a gatekeeper.” The psychologists group added that, although it did not think there were problems with the “no-suicide contract,” it said that the eBook published by the Education Bureau was “difficult to understand and messy.” This month, Hong Kong saw seven student suicides in the space of nine days.

A top Chinese general committed suicide after authorities opened an investigation against him over his links to two corruption-tainted former senior military officers, state media said Tuesday. Zhang Yang, a member of the Central Military Commission, hanged himself in his Beijing home on November 23, the official Xinhua news agency said, citing a commission statement. Zhang Yang. Zhang was the latest official to be ensnared in President Xi Jinping’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign, which has brought down 1.5 million Communist Party officials of various levels as well as top military brass since 2012. Zhang, who was the director of the commission’s general political department, was investigated in connection to Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, top military officials who were expelled from the ruling Communist Party. Guo, a vice-chairman of the commission, became the most senior People’s Liberation Army (PLA) official to be convicted of corruption in half of century when he was sentenced to life in 2016. Xu, also a vice-chairman, died of cancer in 2015 while undergoing a probe for graft. According to Xinhua, Zhang “gravely violated disciplinary protocols and broke the law, was suspected of bribery as well as taking bribes, and holding valuable assets whose origins are unclear”.

Police probe 'death dollars' election note Hundreds of dollars in "rewards" have been offered to anyone in Hong Kong who assassinates two civil servants involved in the recent by-elections. Copies of the letter were also sent to lawmakers Elizabeth Quat and Michael Luk Chung-hung. Letters in the form of a warrant poster offering HK$500 to anyone who manages to kill Anne Teng Yu-yan and Amy Chan Yuen-man, returning officers of the Home Affairs Department, were sent to their officers on Monday. The posters, in Chinese and Japanese, express disappointment over the disqualification of pro-democracy candidates including Agnes Chow Ting. The posters served as an "ultimatum" against the two civil servants. Also in the crosshairs is Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah because the Department of Justice had advised on the disqualifications. A HK$1,500 reward was offered for her murder. Teng, an Eastern District officer, disqualified Demosisto's Chow, who intended to run for a Hong Kong Island vacancy. Chan, based in Sha Tin District, banned localist and district councilor James Chan Kwok-keung and another localist, Ventus Lau Wing-hong, from running in the New Territories East Constituency. Both officers reported the threats to the police on Monday. The threats were signed by a "chairman of the Association of Chinese-holics in Kinki Region" and dated March 18. According to a source, the fact that both cases are being investigated by the New Territories South Regional Crime Unit likely indicates that police believe both threats were from the same source.  A police spokeswoman said they received three more reports beside Teng and Chan yesterday. Police will also approach others who received similar letters to investigate what they classified as suspected "criminal intimidation." Lawmakers Quat and Luk also said they received copies of the letter yesterday. "The letter instigated murder, which is almost terrorist behavior, and it flagrantly challenges our rule of law and election procedure," Luk said. Quat also condemned the sender as naive and shameless, as she believed officials should be free of fear when working in accordance with the law. Other legislators, including newly elected Au Nok-hin and Gary Fan Kwok-wai, received similar letters but decided to laugh it off. Today's Standard

The head of the Education University has said they have “strictly” handled a case involving two students posting slogans “congratulating” a government official on their son’s death. However, they refused to reveal the students’ identity and the punishment. The eldest son of Education Undersecretary Choi Yuk-lin died after falling from a Tsim Sha Tsui flat last September. Signs bearing the slogan “Congratulations Choi Yuk-lin’s son on going west” subsequently appeared on the campus’s Democracy Wall, on top of banners supporting freedom of expression and Hong Kong independence. The two students were later confirmed to be students at the university. A disciplinary committee chaired by a professor, composed of teaching staff and student representatives, reviewed the case. Signs saying “Congratulations Choi Yuk-lin on the death of your son” appeared on top of other signs protesting the removal of banners advocating independence on Education University’s Democracy Wall. Photo: Chung Kim Wah/Facebook. “This incident showed a very clear message. Despite freedom of speech in campus, I hope everyone will respect each other,” Vice-Chancellor Stephen Cheung said. “I believe that university students should bear responsibility for their speech.” He said the committee made reference to previous cases: “I believe they are fair.” Cheung did not reveal whether the students were kicked out of the school after being asked repeatedly, but said there were records left on their files: “Those will certainly have some effect when they wish to study further or work… But we, the Education University, want to give the students a chance to learn.” He said the school had never revealed punishments against students in its history. “I don’t see why we have to make our punishment guidelines and the two students’ names public in this individual incident. I also don’t see why we have to do that in the future as well,” he said. Cheung said the punishments were appropriate and the incident should come to an end after six months. The incident had not affected other students and they have all secured internships at schools this year, according to Cheung. Stephen Cheung. File Photo: Stand News. A poster mocking the death of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has appeared on the campus of the Education University, two days after the poster mocking the death of Choi’s son. Cheung said the individuals could not be identified as they covered their faces almost completely. The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data had said that the Education University violated privacy regulations when it leaked CCTV screenshots of the individuals who posted the slogan. Cheung said relevant guidelines have been updated. Not-for-profit, run by journalists and completely independent – thank you for reading Hong Kong Free Press.

Most teachers find emotional issues in pupils hard to handle A youth group has called on schools to include emotional education in their curriculums after a survey it conducted showed that more than 90 percent of teachers do not know how to handle such problems in their students. Some 97 percent said they needed support on handling students, including the knowledge on how to help pupils manage, express and identify their  emotions. At least 14 students committed suicide between August and December last year and with the new school year about to start, there are fears some students may suffer from emotional problems. The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups interviewed 402 primary and secondary school teachers online in June and July with 93.5 percent saying they faced difficulties when handling students' emotional problems and 97 percent saying they needed support. More than 60 percent said their schools did not provide enough support, with 63.8 percent of these complaining they had no time to talk to students, 43.9 percent admitting they did not have the relevant knowledge and techniques to handle such problems and 36.7 percent saying they found it hard to evaluate a pupil's emotional status. "Many teachers agree that it is important for students to have some emotional education but they don't know how to do this," federation supervisor Hsu Siu-man said.  Hsu said teachers are meant to be the "gatekeepers" of students and help them if they have emotional problems, but have no time for this because of their workloads. "All teachers should possess the right knowledge and techniques and know how to deal with the complicated emotional problems of students," she said. Hui Chun-chun, who is in charge of the school social work unit in the youth group, said many students need help with emotional issues but are afraid to approach social workers as they do not want others to know of their problems. Ricky Chan Chi-wai, of Lions College in Kwai Fong, said many students are unable to get support from their families, either because they have only one parent or because both are working. Chan also said social tensions had also worsened the problem. "They engage in social discussions but find it impossible to share the same views with their families, friends and teachers," he said. Teenagers also need to learn to accept others' opinions and to handle interpersonal conflicts. Besides spending time on students, Chan believes it is more important for teachers to show their consideration and to build mutual trust, so students will seek help from them. The federation suggested schools should include "emotional education" into their regular curriculums to help students identify, express and manage their emotions, and know when to "seek help" and to "help themselves." The group said it will provide training courses to teachers to identify and handle students' emotional problems as well as providing platforms including a consultation hotline and website for teachers who need support.

By Florence Lau “Look, teacher, the dog’s in front! It’s a winner. But, that boy? He’s behind. Such a loser,” my tutee noted as we read children’s book We’re Going On A Bear Hunt. “It doesn’t matter who’s in front. They’re a team; they’re working together. See? There’s no winner or loser.” My tutee nodded dismissively, shrugging off my efforts to convince him that there really wasn’t a winner or a loser in this story. He continued to make similar remarks as we went on, saying things like “look, the dog’s still the winner,” or “the baby’s at the end again – he lost.” File photo: Chspf via Wikimedia Commons. With every comment, my heart sank deeper. Here I was, with a Primary One student, and the only thing that he noticed about the characters was whether they were winning or losing. I kept thinking: “Why is a six-year-old so concerned about who’s a winner or a loser even though the story isn’t about a competition?” When I was six, I would have probably been thinking about how much I’d want to be on a bear hunt with my friends and the many adventures we could be on. So, why was he thinking this way? Well, the answer’s simple. The notorious parenting methods of Hong Kong parents, which are “helpful” in aiding our children to succeed in the Hong Kong educational system, have trained us to become numb to anything but success. When you ask Hong Kong children what they are most proud of, they will often tell you that it’s being among the top three in the class, or winning the championship in a Mathalon. When you ask them what they do during their free time, most of them say that they have no free time, and comment on how busy they are, citing their jam-packed schedules of Chinese, Math, and English tutorials, along with some sports, dance, or music classes. When asked whether they are enjoying those classes, they fall silent, or shake their head and whisper: “my parents are making me do it.” Now, let’s step back and ask ourselves – is this normal? File photo: Apple Daily. The average adult in Hong Kong works for 50.1 hours a week. Given that, let’s figure out the average amount of time children spend working. School starts at 8am and ends at 3pm, making that about seven hours of school time. These kids would also need to go to after-school tutorials to brush up on their mathematics or linguistic skills, each around 1.5 hours. Of course, we can’t exclude the five to seven homework assignments that they get each day, which, on good days, would hopefully take up three hours to complete. Adding it all up, a child would spend 11.5 hours per day working on weekdays. Now, we also have to account for their weekend classes because, naturally, children shouldn’t rest on weekends. Weekends are for levelling up: taking extracurricular classes and squeezing in additional English or Chinese tutorials. I mean, you shouldn’t waste any chance to boost their value in the Hong Kong educational market, right? Enrol them in a dancing, swimming, or piano class. Though one should probably add in lessons for a more exotic musical instrument, since piano classes are the norm now. Assuming that a child takes two classes on the weekends, each two hours in length, he/she would be working for 61.5 hours per week – which is effectively 11.4 hours more than the average adult. File photo: Apple Daily. Why are our children working even more hours than us? Just because their work doesn’t pay and there’s no “boss” looming over them, does that make it any less stressful and overwhelming? You might think: “I’m only helping my children succeed – the more qualifications they have, the higher they score, the greater the chance they will have at getting into a good university, and the greater the chance they will end up with a successful career.” But I’m afraid that is a misbelief. Constantly encouraging them to score better than the kid next door and reinforcing concepts about how important it is to beat the other guy is not going to help them go far in life. It will only push them to become socially awkward and more secluded from other people. Punishing them when they don’t reach your expectations isn’t going to help them improve next time; rather, it will harm your relationship with them and make them products of a system that trains them to work only under external motivation. I am a product of these cruel methods. I had alternating Chinese and English tutorials every day after school, dance classes on Fridays, art classes on Saturdays, and additional Chinese or English lessons over the weekends. File photo: Apple Daily. Then after Primary Three, my parents changed their parenting methods. Though my academic scores weren’t as high as they were back in elementary school, I was happier, had better relationships with people, and kind of turned out okay in the end (I guess). I’m not trying to tell you that it is fine for a kid to get an “F” on a test. But there are many methods to encourage them to improve – more than just locking them up in the kitchen until they promise to score better. And to do well in school, a child doesn’t have to attend tutorials constantly, especially when he or she is not even struggling in the subject. See also: Hong Kong school kids’ happiness hits record low – survey Nothing is more important than letting your children know that you are there to support them no matter what, regardless of whether they win or lose in a competition. While there is still time, teach them love and kindness, rather than rivalry and competitiveness; let them know that there is more to life than “winning” before they are whisked into its harsh reality.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said that almost HK$9 million was recently spent on renovations at Government House, though the alterations were not done upon her request. Lam said the building, which is her official residence and a declared monument, was renovated over two months before she moved in. The Architectural Services Department and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department conduct the maintenance work every time there is a change in chief executive, she said. Lam was speaking to reporters ahead of a banquet with lawmakers at the residence on Monday. Government House. Photo: GovHK. The HK$8.98 million works were related to maintenance, she said: “My family and I live on the second floor, where no works were carried out during this project. I did not ask for any internal improvements, internal renovations or re-partitioning – nothing.” But Lam added that HK$980,000 was spent on constructing a sitting-out area on one of the two tennis courts: “When Government House has an open day or the honours and awards ceremony this week, there will be one more location for guests to take photos, from where they can take a photo of the entire front door -that’s all,” she said. Lam does not own property in Hong Kong. However, her spouse owns an apartment and a parking space in Zhongshan, China for his own use. The sitting-out area at the Government House. Photo: Apple Daily. More discussions urged Ten pro-democracy lawmakers were among those who attended the banquet. Wu Chi-wai, leader of the Democratic Party, said he raised three items: restarting the political reform process, potential collusion with developers in the new Starter Homes scheme, and the denial of entry of British human rights activist Benedict Rogers. After the banquet, Wu quoted Lam as saying that the Chinese State Council declared Rogers’ case to be a foreign affairs matter: “It could only [be handled] like that.” Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung said Lam must mend the rifts in society: “She cannot sweep it under the carpet.” “Of course we can’t easily convince her today… but we will continue observing her attitude in the future,” he said. Pro-democracy lawmakers at the Government House. Photo: Apple Daily. Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen said he raised the issue of scrapping the controversial Basic Competency Assessments for primary three students to the Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung. Ip and social welfare sector lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun also raised the issue of student suicides. Charles Mok, convener of the camp, said the event was a form of regular exchange between the camp and the administration. “I think this is a normal kind of interaction. Obviously the format doesn’t allow us to get a lot of clear answers on specific policies,” he said. “And I think certainly, in addition to this kind of more social type of inter-exchange, we need more opportunities to sit down actually with the chief executive and her principal officials to try to get all our messages across… in a way that we can spend more time, they can spend more time to explain the policies to us and answer our questions.”  Comments

Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen said potential cash handouts to students should be of differing amounts, catered to different needs, rather than a fixed sum for all. The government is expected to report a surplus of more than HK$140 billion in Wednesday’s annual budget. Several media outlets including Now TV and i-Cable cited sources as saying that the government was not inclined to conduct cash handouts, but will give HK$2,000 to grassroots students who qualify for student subsidies and tuition remission schemes. Around 220,000 students from kindergarten up to university level could benefit. The scheme will cost around HK$600 million with handouts beginning at the start of the next academic year in September. Ip Kin-yuen. File Photo: In-Media. Ip said on a Commercial Radio programme on Tuesday that there are practical advantages in giving cash to grassroots students: “But it may be relatively small candy.” He said students at different levels have different needs: “University students may need to pay for internet and they may dine out more, their needs may be bigger.” “Primary school or kindergarten students who may not go out a lot have a different situation. It is an interesting question as to how the amount of HK$2,000 came up.” He also suggested the government could help purchase digital tablets and subside internet fees for grassroots children, as well as increase funds for university research, better facilities and improved teacher training. Financial Secretary Paul Chan. Photo: GovHK. He said it was a good initiative but the scheme may not be in line with public expectations. “People are thinking that we have such a large surplus, maybe we can make a bigger move such as a universal pension scheme,” he said. “The middle class may expect tax and land rate rebates. Compared with these expectations, I believe HK$2,000 is relatively small.” In 2011, then-financial secretary John Tsang launched a scheme whereby permanent residents aged over 18 could receive a one-off HK$6,000 payment. The plan was devised following criticism of his original proposal which involved injecting the sum into Hongkonger’s Mandatory Provident Fund pension accounts. The programme – which was not means tested – cost around HK$36 billion. Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote in a blog post on Sunday that the government has to use public resources reasonably and prepare for the future, amid rumours of cash handouts. For instance, he said resources should be spent on improving healthcare when there is a large surplus.

Guidance counselors say their role not replaceable Social workers should not replace counseling teachers, an alliance of school councilors said, after the government advocated posting a social worker to each school. The alliance, which represents student guidance teachers, said its members had been told by the Education Bureau that teachers should go back to their posts so their counseling function can be taken up by social workers. Counseling teachers and social workers should co-exist, the alliance said. Speaking on a radio program, teachers' group member Ho Lai-har, said: "Why do we have to replace each other? To make things work, they (social workers) have to cooperate with teachers." Ho said about 20 percent of primary schools in Hong Kong have student guidance teachers, which means a total of 120.  Besides counseling, counseling teachers are also responsible for coordinating different departments to arrange activities for students. They also offer student support and life education, while also handling their cases. "Our advantages are we are stable in schools, and we have the chance to learn every student's needs," Ho said.  Ho said posting one social worker to each primary school confuses teachers. They will welcome the policy only if counseling teachers' roles are not made redundant. She said their main concern is not just to "keep their jobs" but to ensure that counseling teachers help children with problems like child abuse. These issues cannot be resolved by just having a social worker in each school. She said many schools with child abuse cases do not have any guidance teachers at all.  "Over the past few years, the government has been more flexible in granting funds. But were those funds put in the right places? Have the funds been used appropriately?" Ho said.  "Why don't we let good teams work together to serve children when there are ample fiscal reserves anyway," she said. Anthony Wong Kin-wai, business director at the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, said suicides among students has been a serious issue in recent years.  sophie.hui@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

A 15-year-old secondary school student from Tsuen Wan has killed himself, becoming the ninth student to do so this academic year. The student, surnamed Ho, was found dead at around 5am on Monday. The police discovered a suicide note at his home. “Unhappy life, want to go to another world,” the note read. According to the police, Ho wrote the note when his mother was asleep, then used the ties to hang himself, Apple Daily reported. Nothing suspicious was found, the police said. Ho’s father said his son was introverted and did not participate in any extracurricular activities or sports. He said his wife had banned him from playing ball games in the street because she was afraid that he would get into bad habits of behaviour. He added that Ho spent his leisure time playing online games. “[I] advised him not to always play computer games. Playing computer games will lead to self harm. He really did harm himself,” he said. Social worker Cecilia Ng Kam-kuen of the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (HKFYG) told the Chinese newspaper Ming Pao that teenagers are usually eager to expand their social circles, and Ho might have felt unhappy if he always stayed at home. Cecilia Ng Kam-kuen (Left). File photo: Apple Daily. This is the ninth student suicide in Hong Kong since school started in September. A study conducted by the HKFYG in August showed that 25% of students have extremely high levels of stress and around 30% said that “they think they’re about to go crazy”. HKFYG interviewed around 4,000 primary and secondary students. The principal at CNEC Lee I Yao Memorial Secondary School, where Ho was a Secondary Four student, said the school has activated the crisis response mechanism with the Education Bureau and social workers were available to comfort affected students and teachers. If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call the Samaritans, a 24-hour multilingual suicide prevention hotline, on 2896 0000.  Comments

Hasty efforts to turn people from depressed and suicidal thoughts may backfire, said the Samaritan Befrienders, as they urged people to listen with empathy and be patient with people at risk. They also warned against commenting indifferently or callously on people expressing depressed thoughts on social media. “We, as humans, tend to hope that we can persuade them as soon as possible [not to be suicidal],” said Ho Wing-hung, Officer for Suicide Crisis Intervention Centre of the Samaritan Befrienders, at a press conference on Thursday. Ho Wing-hung from the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK screencap. “If we quickly show [attitudes] like ‘what you’re thinking is silly’, ‘don’t be like this’, and ‘I’m very positive so be like me’, they [people with depressed thoughts] may think you’re not on the same page as them,” said Ho. “[After this,] they may not come and talk to you again.” He added that simply by listening, people may feel that they are understood and cared for. Ho urged people to contact social workers or even the police if people revealed depressed thoughts or suicide plans online. Photo: Apple Daily. The press conference came on Thursday, after the suicide of a 20-year-old student on Wednesday took the toll of student suicides to 18 since the start of the academic year in September 2015, according to Ming Pao statistics. Communication shifted to social media The Samaritan Befrienders reported a decreased number of young people seeking help from them. They said that in 2015, only 3.5 per cent of the 17,000 cases of people seeking help were young people. “The decreasing number in [people] seeking help is a reflection of the younger generation using online social media for communication,” said Joyce Chow Yuen-fun, the Chairwoman of the Samaritan Befrienders. Left to Right: Wong Yao-wing, Joyce Chow Yuen-fun, and Ho Wing-hung. Photo: Apple Daily. She said that Samaritan volunteers would go into online platforms where young people are active. “We hope that on these platforms, we can find people who might be suffering from emotional distress. If we find any cases, we will initiate counselling and hope to get in touch with them,” she added. She said that the Samaritans Befrienders would increase its “HeartChat” service hours, from 8pm to 12pm on weekdays, to 8pm to 2am. Regarding the cases of student suicides in the past week, she said that copycat suicides cannot be ruled out. She suggested that parents watch the related news with their children and use the chance to express their care. Education Bureau sets up committee Meanwhile, Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim said: “We are going to form a committee to work closely, diligently on the subject.” He said that the committee would include representatives from schools and institutions, parents groups, professional institutions and other related departments. He said that the committee would submit a report in six months’ time. Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim. Photo: Gov HK. Ng also said that the Education Bureau had acknowledged the need for “additional expertise and resources for the educational psychologists and professional counselors”, and would launch five particular district-based seminars, four for schools and one for parents.  Experts react Hong Kong Subsidized Secondary Schools Council Chairman James Lam Yat-fung expressed hope that the seminars could allow teacher representatives to bring knowledge back to their schools to follow up on issues. Amos Cheung Chuen-yih, Chairman of Division of Clinical Psychology, the Hong Kong Psychological Society, said, “I will say that [they] have done something. But is it really a complete remedy for the problems?” Amos Cheung Chuen-yih. Photo: RTHK screen cap. “The core [problem] is the issue of hope – whether this generation of young people feels hope,” he added. Both were speaking on an RTHK radio programme. In response to Ng’s announcement, Chairwoman of the Samaritan Befrienders Chow said that that the focus should be on the root causes of the suicides. “If you don’t solve the root of the problem, the illness may come again.” She added that when young people have problems, the first person they turn to may not be their parents or teachers, but their peers. She said that if their friends learn how to communicate with them and comfort them, even by simply patting them on their shoulders, this is already a good remedy.

HKU student latest case in grim toll  A 20-year-old Hong Kong University student yesterday jumped to his death from the rooftop of a Wong Tai Sin building   the 17th student suicide case since September.  The arts student was certified dead in Upper Wong Tai Sin Estate at 6pm with a suicide note among his possessions. The student, reportedly an only son, lived with his family in Kin Sin House.  When he had lunch with a classmate from secondary school  yesterday, he revealed he was under  huge pressure.  It was also reported that he had good grades at school and was granted a scholarship before, and that he was not in a relationship. The latest case comes amid calls for the government  to deploy more psychologists to help schools identify students with emotional problems. Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim said he is very concerned about the deaths and is holding an emergency meeting today with representatives from the Hong Kong Subsidized Secondary School Council, Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools, Committee on Home-School Cooperation, and psychologists to discuss the issue. Council chairman James Lam Yat-fung said schools need more help in spotting students with mood problems. Such students  tend to hide their feelings and are usually unwilling to share their problems, he told a radio program. FLORA CHUNG Today's Standard

According to results of a survey on standard learning hours conducted by a teen suicides concern group of social workers released in October last year, over 90 percent of the respondents saw the need to establish “standard learning hours”, and over half of them agreed that “standard learning hours” should be set at seven hours a day. When Plato founded the School of Athens more than 2,000 years ago, he had only one agenda in mind: to teach his students how to live a good life and die a good death. Unfortunately, today’s educational institutions have given up on this aspiration. If students want to live a good life these days, their schools would probably refer them to the Scheme on School Drug Testing or simply to the police. The purpose of education is, without question, to stimulate learning. However, schoolwork, which is supposed to be only a tool in facilitating learning, has completely stolen the show in our schools and become the end itself rather than the means. Under our educational system, learning has taken a backseat to excessive schoolwork and endless drilling for exams so much so that these “tools” have become the tail that wags the dog. As a result, the unbearable amount of schoolwork and the haunting stress of exams are not only pushing our students to the breaking point and killing their interest in learning, but are also killing the initial aspiration of education as well. In today’s Hong Kong, a “well-behaved” student often refers to, by our definition, a student who keeps taking notes in class, memorizing the contents of a textbook, doing schoolwork at home around the clock, and preparing for the school lessons the following day. But while spending most of their time memorizing the answers and information, it seems our students hardly have any time to find out the true meaning and origins of these answers. In other words, they may have done a lot of work, but it doesn’t necessarily mean they have actually undergone the process of learning. Against all the odds, the Legislative Council Panel on Education passed a motion I proposed on Jan. 5, urging the Education Bureau to review its existing guidelines on the amount of schoolwork and to proactively consider: 1. establishing maximum schoolwork hours; 2. demanding that schools give the same amount of schoolwork to students on Friday as any other day of the week, and 3. allocating at least one long vacation for students that is schoolwork-free.

On January 24, Ronald Chin, president of the Hong Kong Baptist University, announced the suspension of two BU students who, on January 17, went with other students to the Language Centre to protest against the unfairness of the University’s requirement that students to pass a Putonghua exam as a graduation prerequisite. Chin alleged that the two students had threatened teachers at the centre physically and verbally but – as can be seen from the video record – only one student uttered a Cantonese word meaning “dick”, and no students used any violence.  Cantonese, the mother tongue of most Hongkongers and one of the de facto official oral languages of Hong Kong (the other one being English), is a 3,000-year-old elegant language, still spoken by 100 million people. Putonghua, the official language of China, has a history of at the most 300-400 years. Many Hongkongers think that it is discriminatory to require Hong Kong college students to pass a Putonghua exam as a prerequisite to graduate, while Mainland students studying in Hong Kong are not required to take any course or exam in Cantonese. Quite a few Hong Kong netizens regard this policy as promotion of Chinese colonisation, in view of the fact that Tibetans and Uygurs are forbidden to speak or write their mother language at schools in China. Students whose mother tongue is not Chinese or who have taken Chinese exams in China are exempted from the university’s language requirement. Last year, the school put forth a Putonghua exemption exam for local students too. But the pass rate was only 30 percent. The students attribute this to the assessment standard being unclear. On January 17, a few students, including Lau Chi-kei, chair of the HKBU Student Union, and Chan Lok-hang, a final year Chinese medicine student, went to the Language Centre of the Baptist University to ask the staff to explain how they assessed the students’ Putonghua and to produce the rubrics concerned. But staff refused to respond. And despite the students’ repeated requests, more senior staff at the university refused to talk to the students. The situation dragged on for eight hours. Then, Lau Chi-kei uttered the Cantonese word, lan2卵, which means dick – literally, in the following sentence: “You said you wouldn’t the dick respond – wouldn’t respond to the students’ demands.” But as can be seen from the video, none of the students present at the scene uttered any other swearwords. Nor did they use any physical violence. They did not even make any threatening gestures, although one expatriate teacher at the scene claimed that they were being threatened by the students. Many netizens commented that – when encountering a gross injustice – it is only a normal human reaction to utter a swear word or two. Standoff between students and university staff. Photo: BUSU, via Facebook. On January 24, Lau Chi-kei and Chan Lok-hang publicly apologised for their behaviour at the protest. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the same day, the president of Baptist University announced temporary suspensions for both students for having breached the code of conduct by orally insulting and physically threatening teaching staff of the university. Subsequently, at a press conference held on the same day, Lau and Chan stressed that – on January 17 – they only aimed at reforming the university administration and did not use any violence. They condemned the HKBU president for confounding right and wrong, for paying no heed to students’ studies and safety. It turns out that in recent days, when Chan Lok-hang was studying as an HKBU intern in Canton, he received more than 100 death threats from China netizens. He tried to seek help from the university via a district councillor, Clarisse Yeung. But the president of the school did not any offer help until Lau fled back to Hong Kong on the morning of January 24. Plus, the president has never sent any other word of comfort or reassurance to Chan. Lau and Chan said: “We are now forced to take a path of no return; from now on, we will struggle for students’ rights and welfare without care!” The languages that should be grasped as one of the requirements of graduation are written Chinese and English. Oral languages do not need to be assessed. Even if students’ oral speech is to be assessed, it should only be Cantonese and English. For Cantonese is the mother tongue of most Hongkongers and university students. According to the Basic Law, the official languages of Hong Kong are Chinese and English, but it is not specified whether “Chinese” means Cantonese or Putonghua as far as oral speech is concerned. Nonetheless, for 170 years, Cantonese and English have been the de facto official spoken languages of Hong Kong. Since 1842, in all official situations in Hong Kong, including courts, government departments, Executive and Legislative Councils, schools, mass media, etc., either Cantonese or English are spoken.

Various student bodies, including the HKBU Student Union, Student Christian Movement of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Federation of Students, protested in support of the two suspended students and demanded the University cancel the Putonghua exam or test. Hong Kong Cantonese is a tripartite compound language comprising the Pak Yuet languages, classical Chinese, and loan words from the West. Pak Yuet is a group of ancient minorities living in Southern China, closely related to Vietnamese and Thai. Still spoken by more than 100 million people all over the world, Cantonese can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period around 3,000 years ago. It is a reservoir of elegant and orthodox Chinese culture and language. Instead of suppressing the Cantonese language in Hong Kong, the British colonial government of Hong Kong used to preserve and promote it. File photo: Anthony Wallace/AFP. Contrastingly, Putonghua is an artificial language imposed by the Chinese Communist Party on Mainland Chinese. Due to the mandatory state policy of using Putonghua as the teaching medium at school, Cantonese on the Chinese Mainland has been deteriorating. In recent years, the Education Bureau of the Hong Kong government, which is largely appointed by China, has been using financial subsidies to lure schools in Hong Kong into teaching the Chinese subject in Putonghua instead of Cantonese. Hong Kong should do more to preserve this time-honoured and elegant language.

A group of eminent international figures, including former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, former leader of the UK Liberal Democrats Lord Ashdown, and Myanmar comedian and former political prisoner Zarganar, have condemned Hong Kong’s jailing of pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow. On Thursday, the trio were jailed over their involvement in a clash which sparked the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement protests, following a successful appeal of their sentences by the Department of Justice. The statement, signed by 25 public figures including parliamentarians, lawyers and civil society leaders from the UK, the US, Canada, Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar, described the verdict as “outrageously unjust.” “The decision by the courts in Hong Kong to sentence three courageous, principled young men to jail yesterday is an outrageous miscarriage of justice, a death knell for Hong Kong’s rule of law and basic human rights, and a severe blow to the principles of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ on which Hong Kong was returned to China twenty years ago.” See more: Hong Kong jails Joshua Wong and democracy activists over 2014 Umbrella Movement protests The signatories to the statement include, from left to right: former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom Lord Ashdown, the former president of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed, daughter of Indonesia’s former President Abdurrahman Wahid, Alissa Wahid, and Myanmar comedian and former political prisoner Zarganar.

It took place after a week of class boycotts against the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress’s decision that Hong Kong’s leadership candidates must be vetted before a popular election. The sit-in ended with dozens of arrests of protesters inside the square, with police later using tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters. A 79-day protest occupying the main road around Hong Kong then ensued. Police surrounded student protests at the Civic Square on September 27, 2014. File Photo: Occupy Central with Love and Peace. “At that time, the Hong Kong government described the demonstrations as illegal, invoking the Public Order Ordinance, which has been criticized by the United Nations Human Rights Committee for possibly ‘facilitat[ing] excessive restrictions’ to basic rights,” the statement read. “The law, which requires that processions involving more than 30 people and assemblies with more than 50 must apply for and receive a ‘letter of no objection’ from the government in advance, is incompatible with article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which applies to Hong Kong.” Twenty eminent international leaders, including the former British Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed, Alissa Wahid, daughter of Indonesia’s former President Abdurrahman Wahid, and Myanmar’s Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, today issued a statement condemning the decision by the Court of Appeal in Hong Kong to jail three prominent pro-democracy student leaders, Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow. The statement, signed by twenty respected public figures including Parliamentarians, lawyers and civil society leaders from the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, India and Myanmar, describes “the decision by the courts in Hong Kong to sentence three courageous, principled young men to jail yesterday” as “an outrageous miscarriage of justice, a death knell for Hong Kong’s rule of law and basic human rights, and a severe blow to the principles of “One Country, Two Systems” on which Hong Kong was returned to China twenty years ago.” In addition to Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who served as British Foreign Secretary for the final two years before the handover of Hong Kong, from 1995-1997, and the former President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed, himself a former political prisoner, the signatories include the former Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom, Lord Ashdown, the independent cross-bench Peer and human rights campaigner Lord Alton, the Chair of the UK Conservative Party Human Rights Commission Fiona Bruce MP and the United States Congressman Chris Smith, Co-chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. The statement was also signed by the Burmese comedian and former political prisoner Zarganar, Malaysian Member of Parliament Charles Santiago, the Co-Chair of the Human Rights Committee of the Bar Council of Malaysia Andrew Khoo, the Indian writer and activist John Dayal, Canada’s former Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific David Kilgour, former Canadian Senator Consiglio di Nino, retired United States Ambassador Grover Joseph Rees, former Australian member of parliament Janelle Saffin, Charles Tannock, Member of the European Parliament and Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, former chief prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic. The decision by the courts in Hong Kong to sentence three courageous, principled young men to jail yesterday is an outrageous miscarriage of justice, a death knell for Hong Kong’s rule of law and basic human rights, and a severe blow to the principles of “One Country, Two Systems” on which Hong Kong was returned to China twenty years ago. Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law helped lead the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong in 2014 – one of the most peaceful and restrained movements of public protest the world has ever seen. Joshua Wong and Nathan Law have already served the penalties imposed by a court a year ago. Joshua Wong served 80 hours of community service and Nathan Law 120 hours. Alex Chow received a three-week suspended prison sentence a year ago. Yet the Hong Kong government decided to reopen the case and seek tougher punishments. Yesterday the Court of Appeal jailed Joshua Wong for six months, Alex Chow for seven months and Nathan Law for eight months. Joshua Wong turns 21 in October, an age where he could be eligible to stand for election to the Legislative Council. However, his eligibility is automatically now removed as a result of a six-month jail sentence. Nathan Law, aged 24, was elected as the youngest ever member of the Legislative Council a year ago, but was removed from his seat earlier this year on the grounds that he failed to take his oath properly. Alex Chow is 27 and has recently completed his studies at the London School of Economics. Yesterday’s verdict is not only outrageously unjust because these three young men had already served their sentences and because it strikes a severe blow to Hong Kong’s freedoms, but also because it robs three bright, intelligent, principled and courageous young men of more than half a year of their lives and potentially denies them a future in politics or other employment in Hong Kong. The three student leaders were charged for leading a peaceful sit-in that triggered the 79-day pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in 2014. At that time, the Hong Kong government described the demonstrations as illegal, invoking the Public Order Ordinance, which has been criticized by the United Nations Human Rights Committee for possibly “facilitat[ing] excessive restrictions” to basic rights. The law, which requires that processions involving more than 30 people and assemblies with more than 50 must apply for and receive a “letter of no objection” from the government in advance, is incompatible with article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which applies to Hong Kong. Human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch have long urged Hong Kong authorities to revise the ordinance to comply with the ICCPR. According to Human Rights Watch, imposing new punishments on Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, who had already completed their sentences of community service, may violate article 14(7) of the ICCPR, which enunciates the principle of “double jeopardy” that no one shall be “punished again” for the same offense. In a series of tweets Joshua Wong exhibited his courage even upon learning of his sentence. He wrote: “You can lock up our bodies, but not our minds! We want democracy in Hong Kong. And we will not give up. They can silence protests, remove us from the legislature and lock us up. But they will not win the hearts and minds of Hong Kongers. Imprisoning us will not extinguish Hongkongers’ desire for universal suffrage. We are stronger, more determined, and we will win.” As former heads of government, Parliamentarians, lawyers and civil society leaders, we stand in solidarity with these three brave young men, we condemn yesterday’s verdict by the Court of Appeal, we call for it to be reviewed and for these three political prisoners to be released, and we urge the international community to put pressure on the governments of the People’s Republic of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to respect the principles of “One Country, Two Systems” and the Basic Law in Hong Kong.  Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law should be honoured, encouraged and supported, not jailed. Yesterday was a dark day for Hong Kong and it should be met with international condemnation. “According to Human Rights Watch, imposing new punishments on Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, who had already completed their sentences of community service, may violate article 14(7) of the ICCPR, which enunciates the principle of ‘double jeopardy’ that no one shall be ‘punished again’ for the same offense.” See more: In translation: The Occupy sentence review – why Hong Kong’s appeal court jailed Joshua Wong, Nathan Law & Alex Chow Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Natha Law.

In addition to calling for the appeal to be reviewed and for the three political prisoners to be released, the statement urged the international community to place pressure on the Hong Kong and mainland governments to respect the principles of “One Country, Two Systems” and the Basic Law. “Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law should be honoured, encouraged and supported, not jailed. Yesterday was a dark day for Hong Kong and it should be met with international condemnation.”    Comments

Group seeks summit on suicides An alliance to help prevent student suicides urged the incoming chief executive to set up a "summit" of government and civil groups to prevent the loss of young lives. About 10 members of the Civil Alliance for Student Suicide Prevention protested outside Champion Tower in Central, where Chief Executive-elect Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's office is  located.  They put on blindfolds on which were written "turning a blind eye," criticizing the government for ignoring the problem. Social-welfare sector legislator Shiu Ka-chun said they chose yesterday, Ching Ming Festival and Children's Day, as a memorial to the more than 60 students who have committed suicide since 2015. "They died within Hong Kong's education system and culture of competition and drilling. The government also procrastinated in responding to the issue, and they shifted the blame to the students," he said. The alliance reiterated that the Basic Competency Assessments for Primary Three pupils should be cancelled and urged that a summit to be chaired by the chief secretary be set up to lead interdepartmental work with students, parents, schools and civil groups to examine links between the education system and student suicides. Shiu said the alliance originally planned to meet Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung today but cancelled it after he told them the Legislative Council education panel will discuss the issue on Monday. The alliance also will set up more than 80 streetside booths from tomorrow to collect signatures on pieces of cloth, which will be stitched together to make a quilt. The quilt will be given to Lam once she launches the summit. About 60 of the booths will also be used to explain how harmful resumption of the BCA would be. The spokeswoman of the group's Parents Alliance, Annie Cheung Yim- shuen, denounced Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim for saying the alliance was unprofessional and politicized in opposing the Territory- wide System Assessment. With the booths, she hopes more parents will join their calls to boycott the assessment, adding she fears Lam will not fulfill her election promise to suspend the TSA. "I am 100 percent worried. She is a good fighter, but she may be defeated when facing many people in the establishment," Cheung said. The Education Bureau is studying and following up on the report of the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides submitted in November, according to its online column "Insider's Perspective." Seminars will be held this month for schools and non- governmental organizations to pursue cooperation to enhance students' physical and psychological health, it said. Meanwhile, an Israeli exchange student, 21, was found hanged in her room at Chinese University of Hong Kong International House Monday night. The student, who held a Canadian passport, apparently left a suicide note. Today's Standard

A Form One student jumped to his death on Wednesday, the third suicide since the new school term commenced three weeks ago, giving cause for concern about student stress levels. The 13-year-old boy, whom police said had been unhappy at school, jumped from a window at his Hung Hom residence. He had been a prefect and a member of the basketball team in primary school. He was said to have been facing problems adapting to a new school life and regularly argued with his parents. Another Form One student jumped off a building in Kwun Tong on September 10, while a Chinese University student killed himself after leaving three suicide notes at his Tsz Wan Shan home on September 7. Over the past ten years, more than 110 students have committed suicide, Apple Daily reported. The boy who jumped to his death on Wednesday. Photo: Apple Daily. A study conducted last month by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (HKFYG) interviewed around 4,000 primary and secondary school students. The results showed that 25 percent of students have extremely high levels of stress while 40 percent feel anxious about the new school year. Most of them worry about exams, having too much homework, or that the syllabus will be too difficult. Around 30 percent said that “they think they’re about to go crazy.” Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups. Photo: Apple Daily. The HKFYG hotline received 17,000 requests for help last school year, 7,000 of which were related to schoolwork pressure. Some of those who called were as young as 6-years-old. HKFYG supervisor, Hsu Siu-man, told Hong Kong Economic Times that the commencement of the school term puts a lot of pressure on students. She also said that the mid-term assessments at the end of October are another period of high stress and parents should chat with their children more regularly. “If parents notice that their children are showing signs of having sleep problems, suffering from a poor appetite and appearing distracted, they should seek help immediately,” she said. Hui, a director of social work at HKFYG, told Sing Tao Daily that many Form One students have problems adapting to the new environment, and many of them work late into the evenings due to poor time management. She said that social workers will be following up on students in the schools where they conducted the polls. If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call the Samaritans, a 24-hour multilingual suicide prevention hotline, at 2896 0000.  Comments

Hong Kong has seen a decline in suicide rates among students since the beginning of this school term but the fact that there were still two university undergraduate students and two secondary school students who took their lives this month alone has caused widespread concern in the education sector and society as a whole. The Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides (CPSS) recently published a comprehensive report on the causes of high student suicide rates in the past school year. It concluded that there is no correlation between the rise in suicide rates among students and study-related stress as a result of ongoing education reform. The report immediately came under fire from politicians and members of the education sector who accused the CPSS of deliberately downplaying the the role of mounting stress among students from the education reform. They said the report was intended to cover up the truth and to make the Education Bureau and its overly aggressive reform policy look less responsible for the mounting suicide rates. However, when I finished reading the entire report, I found that the conclusions such as “there is no necessary correlation between the mounting student suicide rate and the education reform” do make sense. Despite the intensifying education reform over the past 15 years or so, the suicide rates among students over the past 30 years have been in decline. The primary school student suicide rates are not only lower than those of our East Asian neighbors but also lower than those in Finland and Australia, where students are widely considered much less prone to school-related stress. The CPSS report was candid about the fact that among the 38 student suicides in recent years, 58 percent were directly related to learning adaptation issues in schools, second to family problems (74 percent). In other words, the report did not seek to hide the truth that over half of student suicides were directly related to learning stress and adaptation difficulties in school. In fact, many of the suggestions put forward in the report have largely been overlooked by the education sector and the public. These include: 1. Identifying students struggling with learning stress as soon as possible and helping them to undergo counselling; 2. Strengthening support for families and enhancing the role of parents in helping their children deal with study-related stress; 3. Facilitating the use of social media in supporting students suffering from stress; 4. Providing more life planning education and career guidance for students. The CPSS’s suggestions made a huge difference. For instance, student suicide rates dropped significantly within four months after the the CPSS had called on the media in its interim report to cover student suicide cases in a lower profile to avoid peer influence on students who are already struggling with stress or family-related issues. I really hope that members of the public could stop blaming everything on front-line teachers as they too are already suffering from a lot of stress. Pointing the finger at our teachers would only exacerbate their stress and would not be helpful in resolving the fundamental issue of study-related stress at all.

The Progressive Teachers’ Alliance (PTA) called for students’ mental health problems to be properly addressed on Monday, after two cases of student suicide were reported this week. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, a 12-year-old student took his own life, making it three cases in four days. A 12-year-old boy reportedly took his own life in Tin Shui Wai. Photo: Wikicommons. “The societal environment in recent years, which values ‘winning at the starting line’ and competition, makes students and teachers suffer from different sorts of pressure,” said the PTA in a statement on their Facebook page. “Of more concern, the excessive focus on academic performance reduced teaching times in schools, in turn sacrificing students’ developmental needs.” The PTA was critical of the Education Bureau for failing to address students’ mental health problems and lacking the manpower to support students to prevent suicide attempts. “We suggest the Education Bureau sets up a working group to completely review the system, resource allocation and existing counselling services… [to allow] students to find help as soon as possible,” it said. Secretary for Education Eddie Ng. File Photo: Stand News. On Sunday, Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim did not address whether the bureau would increase provision of mental support services but said that universities could sort the issues out independently, HKET reports. A medicine student from Chinese University and a Form Four student took their lives on Saturday and Monday respectively, according to local media. The case of the 12-year-old student on Tuesday added to the tally of student suicides, with 17 reporting since the start of the academic year in September, according to Ming Pao.

Another hiker killed A 48-year-old married woman was killed after falling off Suicide Wall on Kowloon Peak when hiking with friends yesterday. Lee Chuk-ching's fall was broken by a tree half way down the cliff. She was airlifted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, where she was pronounced dead four hours later. Lee was hiking with about 10 friends. One of them said the group had climbed up the peak with their bare hands and when they reached Suicide Wall at about 1pm they heard Lee screaming. They turned around and saw her fall. They called police and the Government Flying Service was sent in. It is understood that some of those in the group had experience in climbing the wall, although it was unclear whether Lee - whose friends said loved hiking - was familiar with the route. She was wearing basic hiking equipment at the time. Kowloon Peak, also known as Fei Ngo Shan, is the highest mountain in the Kowloon area, with an altitude of approximately 600 meters. Hong Kong Mountaineering Training Centre founder Chung Kin-man said Suicide Wall - named by the British army back in the 1960s - is a 90-degree cliff with a height of 300 meters. It has become a popular hiking spot in recent years as the dangerous slope offers sweeping views of the city. But Chung said the cliff is not meant for hikers since it is more of a rock-climbing area for professionals. "It requires professional equipment and experience to climb the wall. It is not for the average hiker. Without proper equipment, it is very dangerous," he said. Chung added there are many loose rocks in the area and climbers have to scramble up on their hands and legs. In 2015, a 22-year-old teenage girl also slipped and fell five meters off Suicide Wall. She suffered fractures to her nose, arm and legs and was trapped for 12 hours before being rescued. This is the second fatal cliff fall in four days. On Saturday, San Tin Village head Lau Ho-ming plunged 20 meters off Slim Chance of Survival, a Lantau Island cliff that is notorious for being one of the most dangerous spots along the route. riley.chan@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

New turn on girl's death in bathtub The gruesome death of 12-year-old Ho Mei-kit took another macabre twist yesterday when it was revealed that in addition to being dismembered, her face had also been removed. The girl's 37-year-old mother was last night charged with murder and will appear in North Kowloon Magistrates Courts today.  Police were finally able to contact the father, who is rushing down from Sichuan. A police source said the mother, surnamed Cho, is in an unstable mental state and has not been able to make a statement. The reason for the girl's death remains unknown. But police suspect she was stabbed to death before her face was cut off. There were also several slashed wounds on her skull. Police officers returned to the girl's home yesterday to look for more evidence though it's not clear what they found. Meanwhile, students and alumni attended a memorial service for Ho yesterday. Some citizens also called upon non-profit organizations to help perform religious rituals so the girl can rest in peace. Tong Mei Road Government Primary School, where Ho studied, opened a classroom for the ceremony. A citizen who used to know Ho shared photos of the girl on Facebook, saying that the news broke her heart. "She was such a cheerful kid. She was supposed to spend Christmas with her classmates," she wrote. A neighbor living opposite the family said she could not sleep last night and her three-year-old son was too scared to even leave the home. The murder was discovered on Sunday after a neighbor saw blood seeping out of the 60-square-foot cubicle in Man Fook Building, Mong Kok. Officers found the body of a 12-year-old, chopped up into at least 11 pieces, in the bathtub. Her stomach had been cut open and her internal organs had spilled out. The bathroom was flooded and it was suspected that some parts of the girl's body had been flushed down the toilet, clogging the pipes in the building. It is understood that Cao was born in Sichuan and had the girl with her mainland husband. When the couple divorced, she married a Hong Kong man and moved to the SAR in 2013 under a one-way permit. However, she and her second husband also divorced. Ho is a Hong Kong ID holder and was admitted to Primary Four last year. The school said her conduct and academic performances were good. Ho joined many after-school activities and had good relationships with her teachers and classmates. riley.chan@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

Pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho may have committed a criminal offence in calling for the deaths of those who advocate independence, lawyer and Executive Council member Ronny Tong has said. At an anti-independence rally on Sunday, rural leader Tsang Shu-wo said that pro-independence activists should be “killed” with Ho shouting “without mercy” in response. Ho later said that it was “not a big deal to kill pigs or dogs.” Their comments came after pro-independence banners emerged on university campuses in Hong Kong over the past weeks. On a Commercial Radio show on Monday, he asked: “If those who are pro-independence lead to the subversion of the fate of the country; with Hong Kong and the 1.3 billion people in the motherland having to pay a huge price, why shouldn’t these people be killed?” Junius Ho Kwan-yiu. Photo: HKFP/Catherine Lai. The rally on Sunday also called for Occupy leader Benny Tai to be removed from his teaching position at the University of Hong Kong and linked him to the spread of pro-independence ideas. In response, Tai said that publicly calling for other people’s deaths had “crossed the bottom line of freedom of speech.” ‘Double standard’ He questioned whether the police would take action if such comments were made at rallies held by others. Tai also cited section 26 of the Public Order Ordinance, which says it is an offence to propose violence at public gatherings. “The chief executive should really think about whether to condemn this kind of speech. Isn’t it a double standard to condemn cold-blooded statements but not that which advocates violence?” he said on Facebook. Also speaking on Commercial Radio on Monday, Ronny Tong said that Ho may have also violated 17(b) of the Public Order Ordinance, which criminalises disorder in public places. Tong said that Ho’s comments may be criminal even if he was speaking figuratively. He urged Ho, who is a solicitor, to watch his conduct. File photo: HKFP/Catherine Lai. Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen said on Monday that whether certain conduct or comments constituted a criminal offence would depend on the overall meaning and background, rather than individual words. He stressed again that Hong Kong independence was illegal and unconstitutional. ‘Independence means war’ Ho insisted he was merely expressing his contempt towards evil and said journalists should not take his comments out of context. He also said: “It’s too ironic, someone who has no moral standards, criticising me for crossing the line of moral decency.” “If we’re talking about Hong Kong independence, that means war. What’s wrong with killing enemies in a war?”  Comments

The government has set up a new committee to examine the causes of the recent student suicide incidents in order to make recommendations on appropriate preventive measures. One of the surprise appointees to the committee was the president of the University of Hong Kong’s Student Union. More than 20 students have taken their own lives since the start of the academic year in September last year, including secondary school and university students. The government announced it would form the committee earlier this month. “We are deeply concerned about student suicides, and will mobilise the whole community and promote cross-sector collaboration to prevent further tragedy by devising effective measures to reduce risk factors and enhance protective factors,” a spokesperson for the Education Bureau said in a press release. The new committee in a briefing session. Photo: Facebook/Eddie Ng HK. The committee is chaired by Paul Yip Siu-fai, director of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at HKU. Other members include school principals from primary school and secondary schools, academics, doctors, psychologists and professionals in the social welfare sector. A notable appointee was Althea Suen Hiu-nam – the incumbent president of HKU’s student union – the only student in the committee. It is considered rare for a student to be appointed to a government committee. Suen previously said she supports the notion of independence for Hong Kong, a stance that the government disagrees with. “The government wishes to listen to the views of different parties, and is especially anxious to know how university students perceive the issue and what suggestions they offer,” the spokesperson said. The government added in the release that it is keen to engage “dedicated people of the right calibre, regardless of their political views”, as Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying suggested after the District Council election last November. “As long as young people are willing to contribute, the government will heed their opinions through the work of different advisory bodies.” the release read. Althea Suen. Photo: Stand News. Althea Suen told RTHK that she accepted the invitation as she hoped the committee would include real voices from young people, since the committee’s first task would be to understand the sources of pressure upon students. She added that there has to be a full review of the system to prevent more students from committing suicide, as her fellow students were very concerned about the recent cases. The committee is expected to submit a report in six months. She suggested there could be short term measures before the full report, such as increasing awareness.

Ma Rongrong’s labour pains were unbearable. For hours she had begged for a C-section to ease her agony. After multiple requests were refused, she jumped five floors from a hospital window in northern China to her death. Ma’s family and her doctors have blamed each other for denying her the surgery that could have eased her suffering. Photo: Weibo. The tragedy has attracted intense attention in China, with many wondering how Ma could be denied such a common procedure. There is no clear answer, but the incident has sparked a national discussion on everything from the high cost of health care and patients’ rights to the dangers of traditional Chinese family values. The conversation reached fever pitch this week after leaked security footage showing Ma on her knees in front of her family in a hospital corridor went viral. In response to the uproar, the official People’s Daily said in an editorial that no matter who is ultimately to blame, the incident should serve as a national wake-up call. “It is necessary to pay more attention to pregnant women’s feelings, and pay greater respect to their autonomy,” it said. “We need to have more empathetic understanding and care for them. We cannot only think about policies and interests.” Trading blame  The hospital and Ma’s family have traded blame for refusing her request for a Caesarean, presumably provoking her to kill herself rather than continue suffering through an excruciating labour. The hospital has said it recommended Ma undergo the procedure, but that she and her husband insisted on natural birth in the belief it was better for the child. As evidence, the hospital posted Ma’s surgery log on its official social media account, showing the family had denied her requests. Ma had signed an authorisation granting her husband the right to make medical decisions on her behalf, it said, adding the hospital therefore “had no right to change the delivery method without (his) consent”. Photo: Weibo, But Ma’s husband, Yan Zhuangzhuang, told the Beijing Youth Daily that he had agreed to his wife’s surgery: it was the doctor who said it was unnecessary. Under Chinese law, the decision should have been made by the person herself, according to Feng Lihua, an expert on medical disputes at Beijing’s Zhongdun Law Firm. “It cannot be authorised by other people,” he told AFP. Online uproar  The controversy has been hotly discussed for days, and by the end of the week the hashtag “Yulin pregnant woman jumps to death” was the third highest trending topic on the Twitter-like Weibo. The incident is under police investigation, but the question for many is why Ma was not allowed to choose her own course of care. Some commenters argued the family was not able or willing to pay for the surgery — a common problem in a country where anything other than the most basic medical care can be out of reach for the average person. Others have wondered whether government policy was at least partly to blame for Ma’s death. China has long kept a tight rein on women’s reproductive rights, sometimes using force. After decades of promoting a strict “one-child” policy to limit its booming population, China has reversed course, pushing women to have two children in hopes of rejuvenating the country’s greying labour force. While C-sections are favoured in China as a less painful option, the government has pressured hospitals to reduce the Caesarean rate which is among the world’s highest. “The hospital wants to limit C-sections and the families don’t want to spend money,” said one commenter, airing a view that was widely expressed on social media. “This type of system and this type of family produced this type of tragedy.” The government has also pushed a return to more traditional, Confucian values that privilege the family over the individual. What that means for childbirth is that husbands and their mothers — not women themselves — are more likely to call the shots. “Why can’t the hospital carry out a C-section upon her request?” wrote one commenter on Weibo. “Simply because her family does not agree? What kind of rule is this?” If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255.

Schools will be able to apply for up to HK$150,000 from the Quality Education Fund to promote mental health education among students with activities such as “Retreat Days.” The Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides recommended the measure in a progress report submitted to the Education Bureau (EDB) on Friday. The committee was formed following a spate of student suicides – 20 Hong Kong students have taken their own lives since the beginning of the academic year in September 2015. Paul Yip Siu-fai, chairman of the suicide prevention committee, said the report includes eleven recommendations for improving aspects of students’ mental health. Eddie Ng Hak-kim (left) and Paul Yip Siu-fai (right). Photo: GovHK. The committee’s chairman said 20 per cent of the student suicide cases studied received psychiatric help. See also: HKFP’s comprehensive guide to mental health services in Hong Kong Eighty per cent of suicide cases in the study involved relationship issues with peers and parents, and around 60 per cent involved emotional problems, such as having a negative life attitude or having suicidal thoughts. Eddie Ng Hak-kim. Photo: Stand News. “The Committee found that there were complicated underlying causes for each student suicide case, and that the triggering factors were all different,” said Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim, who received calls for him to resign over the recent influx of cases. Upon accepting the recommendation from the suicide prevention committee, Ng announced that EDB will be launching a campaign in all secondary and primary schools during the academic year of 2016 to 2017. The campaign will focus on enhancing student’s understanding of mental health, will increase public awareness towards the need to seek help, and will reduce the stigma attached to mental illness.

Two university students jumped to their death in Hong Kong in separate cases on Wednesday. At around 1pm, a 21-year-old Shue Yan University psychology student leapt from her sixth-floor flat in Shau ​​Kei Wan, reported Ming Pao. Medics arrived and declared her dead on the scene. She ended her life about an hour before she was due to meet with a psychiatrist to look into her mood disorders, the newspaper said.

On the same day, a Polytechnic University student commited suicide at his Sha Tin home. The 21-year-old fell onto a third-floor platform from the 18th floor staircase of his apartment block at around 11pm, reported Oriental Daily. The victim was a sophomore student from the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering. Before he leapt, the victim shared a picture of the staircase on Instagram and said he was unhappy because of family issues. His mother and sister, who were at home at the time, were “shocked” and “heartbroken,” the newspaper said. A Polytechnic University spokesperson said the school deeply regrets the incident and will provide assistance to the family. If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call the Samaritans, a 24-hour multilingual suicide prevention hotline, on 2896 0000.  Comments

Last week, posters calling for Hong Kong independence and mocking the death of the son of an unpopular official were posted on university campuses, sparking outrage from the public and pro-Beijing camp. A group of 39 lawmakers signed a petition – one mistakenly –  demanding that authorities take action against those who had put up the posters, calling Hong Kong independence “illegal”. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said people had “abused” freedom of speech. Pro-independence notices at CUHK. Photo: InMedia. Over the following week, a variety of apparently satirical posters bearing unorthodox, or even extremist messages, appeared on campuses. Some have since been taken down. As the debate over free speech continues to rage, HKFP translates a selection of the messages: 1. Mockery of Liu Xiaobo’s death Education University was the site of the original poster “congratulating” Education Undersecretary Choi Yuk-lin on the death of her son last Thursday. Amid outrage, the university’s vice-chancellor held a press conference condemning the poster, and rumours spread that employers were cancelling internships for students from the university. Meanwhile, CCTV images of the two men who allegedly posted the messages were leaked to the media. Photo: Screenshot. Then last Saturday morning, a similar poster targeting a different individual – a recently deceased Chinese dissident and Nobel Prize winner – appeared on campus. “Congratulations to Liu Bandit Xiaobo on going west,” read the simplified Chinese message. “Congratulations to [his wife] Liu Xia on being forever house-imprisoned by our party.” Passers-by told Ming Pao they believed that the people who put up the poster intended to test whether the university would react with the same vigour as it did against those who mocked Undersecretary Choi. The university took down the poster on the same day, and condemned it in a statement — though not a press conference – following media enquiries. 2. Independence for Hunan At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, posters advocating Hong Kong independence were removed from campus by a mixture of security staff and students who opposed the idea. So some decided to replace them with another set of similarly-worded pro-independence posters. Photo: Twitter. “The only way out is Hunan independence,” they read, against a background portrait of the province’s most famous son, Mao Zedong. In his youth, before joining the Communist Party, Mao had written newspaper columns supporting the independence of his home province and the dissolution of China – a country then plagued by constant civil war. “The best way is not to construct together, but to break up,” he wrote in Changsha’s Ta Kung Pao on September 3, 1920. “22 provinces, three special zones and two clan areas: That’s 27 places. It’s best to have 27 countries.” 3. Mao on democracy and patriotism The first leader of the People’s Republic was also quoted in posters on the campus of City University. The CityU posters referred to Mao’s teachings on the subjects of democracy and patriotism from 1946 – a time when his rival, the Kuomintang’s Chiang Kai-shek, was in control of China. Photo: Screenshot. “Now we’re talking about patriotism? A love of whose country? Chiang Kai-shek’s country?” read one poster. “How does a government not elected by the people have any face to represent the country? To love a country like this would be akin to betraying the motherland.” 4. Vladivostok reunification As banners calling for independence were torn down across campuses, they were sometimes replaced by posters that condemned separatism. Photo: Screenshot. Yet one satirical poster at Lingnan University called not only for Hong Kong to remain under Chinese rule, but also for the return of Vladivostok. The port city was founded after China’s Qing Dynasty ceded some of its northeastern territories to the Russian Empire under the Treaty of Peking in 1860. Hong Kong Island had been ceded to the British only 18 years earlier. 5. Celebrating the 9/11 attacks After the death of education deputy Choi’s son, Chief Executive Carrie Lam held a press conference, calling those who mocked the tragedy “cold-blooded”. This inspired a poster at the University of Hong Kong satirically ridiculing the annivesary of another tragedy. “Let’s celebrate the 16th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks!” it read in simplified Chinese. Photo: Screenshot. “Sue me for being cold-blooded, stupid,” read another piece of paper in smaller print – in Cantonese – though this message later disappeared. One student later added a hand-written response to the celebratory message: “What [the] fuck is wrong with u?” Student union president Wong Ching-tak told Ming Pao that he did not agree with the message, but the union would not remove posters unless they violated regulations against defamation, personal attacks and obscenities.

A survey by a social group showed that more than half of secondary school students in Hong Kong have depression symptoms. Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service found that as much as 53 percent of secondary school students had symptoms of depression, the highest in six years of the survey, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports. The survey interviewed 15,560 students from 37 secondary schools in 15 districts between October last year and June this year. About 22.3 percent of the respondents said the biggest source of pressure is the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination, followed by academic studies (17.8 percent) and concerns about their future (14.6 percent). About 4.8 percent said they had suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide. One of the depressed students is a 17-year-old who was given the name Chris in the study. He developed depression because of failure in his family relationships and in his studies when he was in Form Two four years ago. Originally, Chris lived with his mother and grandmother but he and his mother moved out when they could not get along with his grandmother. Chris was in an elite class in Form Two in which the learning atmosphere was hugely different from that of his Form One class. He said the elite class made him uncomfortable. He said all his classmates did was study and having in-depth conversations with them was impossible. Chris’s mother had to work long hours. He had no friends in school and felt lonely at home, so he slowly became truant. Chris felt he was useless, saying life gave him no meaning. Last year, he attempted suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. He was discovered in time and sent to hospital. He is now under psychiatric treatment and receives counseling from a social worker. A social worker from Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service said Chris has expectations for himself, always giving himself some tasks that were impossible to meet. Chris’s situation has been stabilizing, and he will repeat his Form Four studies in the new academic year. – Contact us at [email protected] JC/BN/RA 
A collision between a mainland Chinese fishing boat and the American-Danish team during the fourth leg of the Volvo Ocean Race left one man dead, police said Saturday, overshadowing a historic victory for the Hong Kong team as the city hosted the race for the first time.

Local group Sun Hung Kai/Scallywag triumphed despite some significant setbacks in the gruelling 5,800 nautical mile stage from Melbourne, Australia, closely followed by China’s Dongfeng Race Team in second place.

Hong Kong police told AFP that one man from the fishing boat had died after being airlifted to hospital while nine others were rescued from the sea. In a statement organisers confirmed the death and said the incident happened approximately 30 miles from the finish, outside of Hong Kong waters at around 01:23 am local time Saturday. “The Volvo Ocean Race is deeply saddened to inform that the collision between Vestas 11th Hour Racing, a team competing in the Volvo Ocean Race 2017-18, and a fishing vessel has resulted in a fatality of a crew member of the fishing vessel,” it said. “We offer our deepest condolences to the loved ones of the deceased… All involved organisations are co-operating with the authorities and are fully supporting the ongoing investigation.” Embed from Getty Imageswindow.gie=window.gie||function(c){(gie.q=gie.q||[]).push(c)};gie(function(){gie.widgets.load({id:'e-jAGidGTupHggqnyQZzYg',sig:'Q9w9RQYRDGwSb7Ac2htvBppxQLlV7lDNLHwxCcM9n_Q=',w:'594px',h:'385px',items:'907368458',caption: true ,tld:'com',is360: false })}); All Vestas crew members were safe but the boat was damaged according to an earlier statement, with the incident forcing the team to officially retire from the fourth leg. The Dongfeng team’s website said the Vestas was in second place and being chased by Dongfeng when the accident occurred. French skipper Charles Caudrelier had offered help to his Vestas counterpart Mark Towill but was told none was required, it said.   “Our first thought is that this is terrible news. We are of course very sad to hear it and very concerned about the fishing boat and await further news on that,” Caudrelier was quoted as saying minutes after finishing. “It is always very dangerous when sailing in these fishing areas when there are so many boats and some have no lights.” Tough passage  The seven boats had embarked on the fourth leg in early January, heading north up the east coast of Australia with the navigational challenge of dodging numerous islands. Scallywag, skippered by Australian David Witt, led the flotilla into their home port at around 0145 am local time (1745 GMT Friday), crossing the line in 17 days, 14 hours, 30 minutes and 42 seconds.

But we stuck to our guns, did what we thought was right and it’s worked out.” Dongfeng arrived just hours later to clinch the runner-up spot, with Caudrelier noting it was great news for Asian sailing. Dutch group Team AkzoNobel came in third place while Spain’s MAPFRE finished fourth, followed by Team Brunel and Turn The Tide On The Plastic. The 2017-18 Volvo Ocean Race is the longest in the competition’s 44-year history, stretching over eight months and 45,000 nautical miles around the globe ending in The Hague in the Netherlands in late June.

'Gatekeeper' call to prevent student suicides Mental health education should be strengthened to make every teacher, student and parent "gatekeeper" in preventing student suicides, said a committee set up after a spate of students taking their own lives. The Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides yesterday submitted its final report to Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim after six months of analyzing 71 student suicides in the past three academic years.  It found that 20 percent of the victims were suffering from mental health problems, compared with overseas figures of about 90 percent. It indicates that students with mental health problems were not identified early enough, said Paul Yip Siu-fai, committee chairman and director of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong. Yip said mental health education can empower everyone at school to pick up certain signals of mental illness, so that early intervention is possible to save lives. Asked about the teachers' hectic schedule and availability of resources, Yip said the measures should not burden teachers as training services will be delivered to schools. The Education Bureau should provide schools with additional resources to boost mental health and well-being education, the committee suggested. Apart from the "gatekeeping" training, support should also be given to parents, such as outreach education programs by the Social Welfare Department and non-governmental organizations, to locate the hard-to- reach or hidden parents in struggling families. Yip said Hong Kong "has a lot of problems" to deal with when it comes to the education system, for example, the exam-oriented culture and the low university admission rate, which put pressure on the students. However, the report said suicidal behaviors are caused by various factors, including mental health issues, psychological concerns, family relationship and adjustment problems, peer relationship problems, as well as school adjustment and academic stress. "According to the report by the committee, there is no direct correlation between student suicidal cases and the overall education system per se," Ng said. He said the bureau will study when to put the committee's suggestions into practice and that the government has already taken measures to reduce homework stress for students and simplify the curriculum. Education-sector lawmaker Ip Kin- yuen, however, expressed regret at the conclusion and accused the bureau of turning a blind eye to calls for a complete reform of the education system. "The cause of student suicide is for sure complicated but support from school definitely plays an important part. The committee should study the relationship between student suicide and education," Ip said. There were 18 student suicides in the period from January to April this year, compared with four between May and August. Yip attributed the drop to efforts by the whole community and responsible media, as data showed that sensational reports may cause a copycat effect. Other than traditional media, the committee suggested the government should also strengthen promotion of online citizenship in social media.  Today's Standard

More than a thousand individuals and organisations have signed a petition urging the government to speed up the legislation of a gender recognition ordinance after the death of a transgender woman earlier this month. The woman died after falling from an overhead bridge at Tai Wai MTR station on July 8. Previously, she had said on Facebook that she felt unable to “fit into society.” The petition says that the incident reflects the “hostile” treatment faced by transgender people in Hong Kong. It requests that the government set a timetable for the legislation and immediate implementation of a gender recognition ordinance in order to reduce “the hardships and discrimination” faced by the community. Photo: Dan Garrett The petition says that the ordinance should adhere to international human rights standards set by the United Nations in guaranteeing the protection of people of different genders, including transgender and intersex people. Intersex is a term used for conditions whereby a person is born with a sexual or reproductive anatomy that does not fit the typical definitions of female or male. Homelessness, termination without cause, immigration detention, and street harassment, intimidation, and violence were listed in the statement accompanying the petition as some of the issues the community face. See also: The ‘bathroom hurdle’: A transgender woman’s fight for legal recognition and safe spaces ‘Blood on their hands’ Ray Chan, Hong Kong’s first openly-gay lawmaker, spoke to HKFP about the government’s “inertia” in enacting legislation that would ban discrimination and recognise diverse gender identities. “Those who [are] opposed to legislation, and those who use the worst language and exhibit egregious behaviours to reject us as full members of society have blood on their hands.” Ray Chan. File Photo: HKFP/Ellie Ng. Joanne Leung, chairperson of the Transgender Resource Center, said that anxieties and concerns surrounding transgender people were “without empathy and sense.” See also: Anti-LGBT groups warn of ‘reverse discrimination’ and threats to free speech if gay people are protected Media misgendering The statement accompanying the petition said that media reporting about the incident showed “a lack of respect and discrimination,” after it was initially reported that the victim was a man. “An identity she did not recognise as her own was forced upon her,” said the statement. The petition says that the media should respect the transgender and intersex community in its future news reports and programmes. It said that the terminology used should adhere to individuals’ self-identified gender identities. File photo: Rainbow Action. As of Monday, the petition had 1,008 co-signers, including LGBTQ non-governmental organisations Rainbow of Hong Kong, the Association of Transgender Rights, and BigLove Alliance. Political parties such as Demosisto, the League of Social Democrats, and the Progressive Lawyers Group have also signed.  Comments

Motive mystery after girl, 12, chopped up Homicide detectives are probing a woman suspected of killing her 12-year-old daughter and chopping her body into at least 11 pieces, some of which clogged the bathtub of a Mong Kok flat. The 37-year-old mother, surnamed Cao,who moved to Hong Kong four years ago, was arrested in connection with the death. Police are trying to find the father. Mong Kok assistant district commander Chung Chi-ming said the girl, Ho Mei-kit, was a Primary Six student at Tong Mei Road Government Primary School. Officers went to the school yesterday. A neighbor said she heard chopping noises coming from the flat at around 3pm on Sunday. They lasted 30 minutes. This was followed by a strong smell of bleach. At 7pm, she saw Cao borrowing a mobile from another neighbor, saying her phone was "under surveillance" and that she needed to call her husband for help. When the woman refused to return the phone half an hour later, the neighbor confronted her outside her flat and saw some blood on the floor. Police rushed to the partitioned flat on the third floor of Man Fook Building, 1182 Canton Road, Mong Kok, but Cao refused to open the door.  Officers forcibly entered the 60-square-foot cubicle and found body parts in the bathtub. The stomach was cut open and there were internal organs that spilled out. "Her head, organs and body were mutilated. The bathroom had flooded and this was affecting neighboring flats," Chung said. It is suspected that Cao had flushed some parts down the toilet, clogging the pipes. Chung said the mother had no record of mental history or domestic violence but witnesses said she was mumbling to herself before she borrowed the phone. Police removed 11 bags of body parts from the scene. They also seized a chopper, two phones and a bottle of bleach. An investigation by the District Crime Squad of Mong Kok is under way. Sources said the mom works as a night-shift masseuse and has substance abuse issues. She was born in Sichuan and had the girl with her mainland husband. When the couple divorced, she married a Hong Kong man and moved to the SAR in 2013 under a one-way permit. However, she and her second husband also divorced. Tong Mei Road Government Primary School vice principal Lui Ching-yee said the school was saddened by the news. She said Ho was admitted to Primary Four last year. Her conduct and academic performance were good. Ho joined many after-school activities and her relationship with teachers and classmates was good. The school has since established a crisis management team, she said. A spokesman said the Education Bureau sent psychologists to the school. Criminologist Lai Ding-kee said the alleged murder could be the result of "frustration built up over the years."  He added: "Given that the woman is young, she might have thought that her daughter was a burden and prevented her from marrying again." The City University instructor also suggested that Cao might have blamed her daughter for her two divorces. riley.chan@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said a new drug will soon be available in Hong Kong to help patients suffering from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) increase their chances of a longer life. SMA is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting, which often leads to early death. Josy Chow Pui-shan, a 23-year-old University of Hong Kong (HKU) student majoring in English and linguistics, was born with the rare disease. She had taken pains to write to the government, calling on it to import a new drug named Spinraza, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration but not yet registered in Hong Kong. Lam paid a visit to Chow at the HKU student residence on Thursday morning. The chief executive was accompanied by Secretary for Food and Health Prof. Sophia Chan Siu-chee and Professor Gabriel Leung Cheuk-wai, dean of the university’s Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine. She told Chow that the drug she has been waiting for will arrive in about two months’ time at the earliest, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports. According to Lam, she wrote to the drugmaker a few months ago and expressed the government’s hope to see the drug introduced in Hong Kong, and the pharmaceutical company agreed. Lam acknowledged Chow’s contribution in making this happen and praised her bravery and perseverance. The chief executive also revealed the government will allow eligible SMA patients to get the drug for free under an Expanded Access Programme before the drug registration procedure in Hong Kong is completed. Experts from the Hospital Authority will conduct the preparatory work at full speed, with a view to allowing the program to be implemented within two or three months. Lam said the Department of Health will help in having the drug registered and include it on the government’s list of subsidies for ultra-expensive drugs. Hearing the good news, Chow, who is paralyzed from the neck down and is only able to move two fingers in her right hand, said with tears in her eyes that is the best gift for her birthday that is coming up next Saturday. At a press conference arranged by the university on Thursday night, Chow aid she could not believe that her dream has finally come true and thanked Lam for not giving up on her and other SMA patients. In response to media inquiries about the matter, Hospital Authority chief executive Dr. Leung Pak-yin said only SMA Type I patients could be given the drug for free once it is introduced under an agreement between the government and the drug maker. The government hopes to include Type II patients under the program by the end of this year. – Contact us at [email protected] TL/JC/CG 
I am glad to learn that Chief Executive Carrie Lam has incorporated in her first policy address some of the proposals put forward by the local healthcare sector to step up efforts at promoting grassroots healthcare service. In order to promote public health “at source”, we believe the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority must give equal priority to health management and disease prevention at the grassroots level rather than just focusing on providing therapies and hospitalization. This new approach can also guarantee the healthy and sustainable development of our public healthcare system. We are delighted that the chief executive has accepted our suggestions. In her policy address, Lam also proposed setting up a steering committee on primary healthcare development and establishing a pioneering district healthcare center in Kwai Chung that provides the public with comprehensive and diversified professional healthcare services such as patient care, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and medication consultation. She also vowed to foster cooperation between healthcare providers and members of the community as well as between the private and public medical sectors at district levels. I agree that these initiatives can help enhance public awareness about the importance of personal health management and disease prevention, as well as strengthen support for chronic patients in the community, so as to alleviate the pressure on our public specialist clinics and hospitals in the long run. In her policy address, Lam also took our suggestions about relieving the mounting pressure on our public hospitals by strengthening the role of nurse-led clinics, extending the range of services provided by clinical pharmacists and enhancing the multidisciplinary medical services in our public psychiatric clinics. I also welcome the government’s promise to increase funding for the Hospital Authority in such a way that the administration would gradually raise regular funding for the agency according to the pace of our population growth and the state of our demographic changes following a three-year cycle. On top of increasing funding, I also urge the government to implement the recommendations made by the steering committee on the review of the Hospital Authority such as immediately redressing the balance for resource allocation in our public healthcare sector and, more importantly, addressing the issue of acute staff shortage in our public hospitals. I am deeply concerned about the sluggishness of the administration in tackling staff shortage in our public hospitals. That said, I will continue to push for greater government efforts at human resources policy reform and staff retainment, and demand the formulation of a long-term human resources planning in our public healthcare sector. Apart from the new initiatives already laid down in the policy address concerning mental healthcare services, in order to reverse our worsening student suicide rates, I also call on the government to implement the “one school, one nurse” policy in our schools immediately. Under this policy, there would be at least one registered psychiatric nurse stationed in every primary and secondary school as well as university in the city, who can identify high-risk cases and intervene immediately before tragedy strikes. I also strongly suggest that the administration promptly improve the ratio of case managers to mental patients, increase the number of psychiatric nurses and provide quality follow-up and rehabilitation services for mental patients. Meanwhile, the government should also divert more resources into providing support for their family members. There is still a whole bunch of pressing medical issues which the policy address didn’t touch on, such as enhancing the social hygiene service under the Department of Health, providing more support for patients of rare diseases, allowing mentally disabled individuals access to affordable dental care service and setting up a special task force to oversee the development of the local Chinese herbal medicine industry. I sincerely hope that the government can address these issues promptly and act accordingly. Last but not least, I am disappointed that the policy address failed to answer calls from healthcare workers for better regulation of the sector. Our demands include reforming the Nursing Council of Hong Kong so that at least a portion of its members will be chosen through election in the near future, mandating that the five management committees under the Supplementary Medical Professions Council be chaired by members of the healthcare sector, establishing a regulatory body for pharmacists and striking a balance in the representation of members of the Chiropractors Council. I hope the government can follow up on these issues immediately.

15TH STUDENT SUICIDE The suicide of a 15-year-old boy yesterday should serve as a wake-up call for  parents and teachers as it underlines an alarming trend among students, according to experts. It was the second student suicide in three days   and the 15th in the current school year.  Police said Chow Yu-hang, a Secondary Four student at St Bonaventure College and High School, jumped off the podium of a shopping mall   reportedly 18 meters high   in Chuk Yuen (South) Estate in Wong Tai Sin. He left his home in Cheong Sin House, Upper Wong Tai Sin, after sending a final text message to his mother,  police added.  "He said he was tired and did not want to go to school and live anymore," a source said.  A friend, Tsui Hon-yeung, a Year  One medical student at Chinese University,  said Chow was usually optimistic and outgoing.  "We went running every Saturday but we seldom talked about school and family," Tsui, 18, said. Tsui said Chow was part of a team that came in tops in the  4x400-meter race of a recent interschool competition. Of the 15 student suicides, six were from Chinese University, including Year Three medical student Christy Cheung Wing-yan. The 20-year-old jumped to   her death from her flat in Dawning Views, Fan Ling, on Saturday. CUHK's faculty of medicine yesterday  organized a memorial ceremony for Cheung. Police were informed of Chow's death by his mother and a passerby. Officers at the scene took away a mobile phone found in a plant bed on the podium. Chow was sent to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. "The situation is worrying and should raise the concern of everyone, said professor Paul Yip Siu-fai, director of the University of Hong Kong's Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention.  "Some young people are so involved in the cyber world that they find it difficult to communicate and share their feelings with others in the real world." Yip added that weak emotional support from families   especially from single parents   is also a crucial factor. "We know that the school curriculum in Hong Kong is intense and sometimes frustrates students," he said.  "That is why schools should also consider a student's ability to deal with difficulties and pressure instead of just chalk and talk."  Chow allegedly skipped classes for a few days before the incident.  The school issued a statement saying Chow actively participated in extracurricular activities and had good relations with his teachers and schoolmates.  They said Chow's academic performance was average. In December, a six-year-old student attempted suicide by holding a pair of scissors to her neck.  The Primary One student said she could not cope with primary school life and wanted to go back to kindergarten.  Today's Standard

A 15-year-old is believed to have jumped to his death early Monday in Hong Kong, the second such case in three days involving the student community in the city. Henry Chow Yu-hang, a Secondary Four student at St Bonaventure College and High School, was found lying unconscious on Nga Chuk Street in Wong Tai Sin at about 12:11 am. A passer-by spotted him and alerted the police, who arrived with paramedics. Chow was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police suspect that Chow jumped off a shopping mall in Chuk Yuen (South) Estate as the student’s mobile phone was left at the podium of the mall. Officers didn’t find any suicide note at the scene, but it is believed that Chow took his life due to academic pressures. Apple Daily cited a source as saying that Chow sent a text message to his mother at midnight Monday and told her he doesn’t want to go to school or live anymore. Chow is said to have been absent from school for several days before his death. One of his friends who is medical student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) said Chow was enthusiastic about running and that his team had just won first place in a recent 4×400-meter interschool race competition. The suicide came after a 20-year-old woman who was studying medicine at CUHK jumped to her death from her flat in Fan Ling on Saturday. Data shows that there have been 18 student suicides in Hong Kong since the city’s current school year began in September last year. Seven of the cases involved university students while ten pertained to high school students and one case involved a person studying at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education. Expressing concern about the phenomenon, Tsang Chin-kwok, director of the non-governmental organization Samartian Befrienders Hong Kong, said most cases of student suicides are related to academic issues or depression. Many young people of this generation are single children in their families and they lack the ability to tackle problems, Tsang said. The students feel frustrated easily and tend go to extremes when they do not perform well in academic studies. Dr. Lobo Louie of the Department of Physical Education at the Hong Kong Baptist University, was quoted by Ming Pao Daily as saying that normally a young person like Chow who loves sports would think positively and is less unlikely to be bothered by depression. Chow’s suicide should be treated as an isolated case, he said. Students who perform well in sports but not in academic studies can work their way to become professional coaches, as there are undergraduate or associate degree courses provided by different institutions, he said. Many private clubs, schools, community centers or NGOs need coaches or assistants in sports and recreation activities, Louie noted.

The tragic suicide of a 26-year-old Taiwanese writer has sparked a debate in Taiwan. Lin Yi-han published her first, and bestselling novel, Fang Si-Chi’s First Love Paradise, in February. The book details the story of a teenage girl who was seduced and coerced into sex by her cram school teacher. After Lin was discovered dead in her own home late April, her parents released a statement through her publisher Guerrilla Publishing. They revealed that the events detailed in the novel were Lin’s own experiences, and said that the main cause of her death was not her depression but her alleged rape by a celebrity tutor 8-9 years ago. Photo: Facebook/Lin Yi-han. “Her goal for writing the book was in the hope that there will not be another Fang Si-chi in society, in the hope that all the parents, and the kind boys, girls, and men in the world, can use tenderness and warm spirits to protect the Fan Si-chis of the world.” The stories of the four female characters in the book were all based on Lin’s own experiences, but she chose to tell them through multiple characters in order to protect her parents and her family, they said. Lin was open about her depression or bipolar disorder and made several attempts to take her life previously, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency. She never confirmed whether her work was autobiographical. Following her death, public debates about rape, mental health, and problems in Taiwan’s education system sprang up. Netizen manhunt  Social media users also launched a manhunt for Lin’s alleged abuser. Following online allegations, cram school tutor Chen Kuo-hsing admitted that he had a two month affair with her. He said that it happened in August 2009, when she was no longer his student, and that the pair ended their relationship after her parents found out about it. Lin would have been over 16, Taiwan’s legal age of consent. The cover of Lin’s book, Lin Yin-han. Photo: Guerilla Publishing/Facebook. The events have inspired some to come out about their own experiences with sexual assault on Taiwanese social media PTT. Others questioned Lin, asking why sympathy was warranted for an adulteress, speculating about her mental state, and commenting on her physical appearance, according to The News Lens. It also spurred calls for stricter laws in Taiwan governing the tutoring industry. A draft bill requiring staff at cram schools to use their real names in ads and contracts passed its first screening at Taiwan’s legislature on Wednesday.

More than 90 percent of students, parents and concern groups are in favor of limiting “study hours” to reduce stress and help prevent suicides, according to an ongoing survey. The survey is being conducted by the Reclaiming Social Work movement between July and October, hk01.com reports. More than half of the respondents agreed that the limit for the number of standard school hours should be under seven. As of Saturday, 631 students, parents, teachers and social workers had done the questionnaire online or in person. About 93.6 percent of the interviewees said there should be a standardised amount of class time for students. And 52.6 percent said that seven hours of standardised learning time would be best for students while 19.3 percent agreed that five hours is the most appropriate. The scope of the learning time should include extra classes or tutorial classes, or any other sort of academic-related learning. Parents’ Union spokesperson Cheung Yim-king said the minimum requirement should be less than seven hours and that after school there should be no homework or extra tutorials. She said that the time after school is supposed to be the best time for parents and children to establish relationships. Lai Pak-yin, the survey’s spokesman, said the main reason for stress in students is school work, which in turn has been blamed for student suicides, according to Apple Daily. Students spend more than 10 hours on school work, and the student-to-teacher ratio is among the worst in the world. Lai said discussions are continuing on standardizing the study hours for students, which would allow them to explore other interests and have fun. He said schools should adopt guidelines on when to encourage students to relax. Meanwhile, legislative councilor Shiu Ka-chun led a protest in Mong Kok to dramatize the plight of stressed-out students. Shiu said he would continue to express his views to education authorities. The Education Bureau has yet to respond to the survey. - Contact us at [email protected] EL/BN/RA 
The school year had barely begun when two incidents—both testing the limits of free speech on campus—unfolded at Chinese University and Education University and sent management scrambling for a response. On Monday, at least three large banners bearing the words “Hong Kong independence” were spotted in various locations at Chinese University, including one that draped across the famous “Beacon” sculpture outside the school’s main library. Within hours, the banners were removed by the school authorities. Photo: CUHK Secrets. A few days later, a sign “congratulating” Education Undersecretary Choi Yuk-lin on her son’s recent suicide appeared on Education University’s Democracy Wall, a public bulletin board for students to express opinions and exchange views. Likewise, the sign was taken down shortly thereafter. That could have been the end of the controversies had university management not succumbed to the temptation to say a few choice words of their own. In the end, it was the reaction from the school authorities that added fuel to the squabble and escalated them into an all-out war of words that questions how far free speech should go on campus. When pressed to explain the removal of the pro-independence banners, Chinese University President Joseph Sung punted the question but hinted at the notion of illegality, remarking that “as long as [an expression of opinion] is not illegal or disruptive to other people’s learning, we will not have too big of a reaction.” The accusation of unlawfulness wasn’t explicitly articulated until the following day. In a letter addressed to the student union, a university management committee pontificated that the discussion of independence “violated Hong Kong’s laws and also violated the school’s constant stance of absolutely opposing Hong Kong independence.” The language was so absolute and unequivocal that it left one wondering whether a police crime unit should have been dispatched to Sha Tin. Joseph Sung. Photo: Wikicommons. In an equally absolute and unequivocal tone, Education University President Stephen Cheung decried the sign mocking the death of Undersecretary Choi’s son. At a press conference, an irate and almost teary-eyed Cheung called the behaviour “shameful” and “offensive” and said it “overstepped our moral boundaries” and “rubbed salt in another’s wound.” Cheung went on to apologise to Choi’s family on behalf of the entire university. He also told reporters that an investigation was underway and that a disciplinary committee would decide on the appropriate punishment for the perpetrators. Intentionally or not, the school authorities later leaked CCTV footage of the individuals allegedly responsible for posting the sign. Any constitutional lawyer will tell you that no right is absolute—not even the freedom of expression. In much of the common law world, courts have come to similar conclusions over the limitations of free speech. Libel, pornography, incitement of violence and hate speech are but a few areas where the freedom of speech is deemed in conflict with other rights and freedoms and therefore may be curtained. In the United States, the First Amendment guaranteeing free speech is perhaps the most argued provision in the Bill of Rights. A series of high profile Supreme Court decisions have carved out seven permissible encroachments on expression: obscenity, child pornography, defamation, incitement to riot, fighting words, copyright infringement and false advertising. Photo: HKFP. In Hong Kong, freedom of expression is enshrined in Article 27 of the Basic Law. Limits on free speech by and large follow English case law and are for the most part consistent with the classic exceptions enumerated earlier. When Chinese University management slammed the pro-independence banners as “illegal,” they were alluding to Article 1 of the Basic Law which stipulates that “[t]he Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China.” The banners supporting Hong Kong independence, according to the university, contravene Article 1 and are therefore unconstitutional. But that’s where the school authorities got confused and hopelessly wrong. Even though the act of secession itself is unlawful, supporting it isn’t—at least not until an anti-subversion law is enacted. Every day, citizens, lawmakers and government officials debate matters that are potentially or in fact unconstitutional. There is no common law prohibition on the “discussion of illegal acts.” For instance, the government’s joint checkpoint proposal at the West Kowloon railway terminal is in clear violation of several provisions of the Basic Law. At least two judicial reviews have been filed to challenge its lawfulness in local courts. But that hasn’t stopped Carrie Lam and her cabinet from hard-selling the plan to the public like used car salesmen. Following Chinese University’s argument, then every television advert and MTR poster promoting the co-location proposal ought to be taken down for illegality. An Express Rail Link train. Photo: MTR If the West Kowloon comparison is too obscure, there are plenty of other examples to look to. Activists fighting for marriage equality or access to medical marijuana should be free to wave rainbow flags or hand out leaflets explaining the health benefits of cannabis. Neither same-sex marriage nor marijuana use is legally permissible, but that’s precisely the point of free speech: to debate whether they should be. Can you imagine the upheaval if university management starts removing rainbow flags from campus for “promoting the currently unlawful act of same-sex marriage”? By the same token, any reasonable person should be equally outraged by Chinese University’s misguided—if not altogether anti-intellectual—decision to take down the students’ pro-independence banners, regardless of one’s personal views on that issue. For a respected institution that has long been regarded as a vanguard of the city’s liberal ideals, the latest turn of event is a shocking disappointment. What about President Cheung’s righteous indignation toward the distasteful sign at Education University? Without a doubt, the sign making light of a suicide was mean-spirited, juvenile and cruel. But free speech isn’t about being nice or mature or kind—it is about the freedom to be all of those things as long as we don’t violate someone else’s rights. The sign fell far short of a “hate speech”, which refers to offensive words targeting a person or group on the basis of a collective attribute such as race, religion, ethnic origin or sexual orientation. Even though the behaviour in question was hateful, it is nonetheless legitimate free speech. Cheung’s high-profile condemnation of a single insensitive sign is nothing short of an overreaction. It also begs the question as to whether he would have made so much fuss had the sign not been directed at a senior government official. For if a university president were to apologise for every silly post on an open forum, or if he has to convene a disciplinary committee to punish every student for an unpleasant comment, he would be a very busy man. A banner mocking Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia. Photo: Screenshot. Sure enough, the day after the incident, another pain-in-the-neck put up a sign slighting the death of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in retaliation of the anti-Choi post. Will Cheung call another press conference and put on the same indignant face? If he doesn’t, why not? There is no denying that some speech is more tasteful than others—the one that appeared in Education University clearly wasn’t. Many also believe independence to be a pipe dream and a path to disaster. To the average Hong Konger, both acts by university students this week were schoolboy antics that shouldn’t be encouraged. But while they may be bad ideas, they are constitutionally-protected bad ideas.  Comments Jason Y. Ng is a Hong Kong-based lawyer, university professor and writer.

Protests erupted during Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s Q&A session at the legislature on Thursday over labour and welfare issues, education, as well as Hong Kong’s autonomy. Pro-democracy lawmakers did not chant slogans as they did on Wednesday, when Lam read out parts of her first policy address. “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung of the League of Social Democrats, heckled Lam as she entered the chamber. Leung was one of the six lawmakers disqualified by a court after a government legal bid to oust him – however, he returned to the public gallery at the Legislative Council as a private citizen.  He shouted “shame on Carrie Lam” and “shame on stealing from the poor to give to the rich,” demanding that Lam implement standard working hours for citizens, and a universal pension scheme. LegCo President Andrew Leung ordered security guards to remove him. People Power lawmaker Ray Chan was also asked to leave after he staged a protest over Hong Kong’s denial of entry to British human rights activist Benedict Rogers. Rogers was turned away by Immigration officials on Wednesday morning. He said that the incident was a result of Beijing’s interference in Hong Kong, as the Chinese embassy in London had warned him through an intermediary that he should not visit jailed activists in Hong Kong, and he would be barred from entry.

Asked on a joint radio programme on Thursday if Rogers was barred because the Chinese government did not wish for him to enter, Lam said that – under the Basic Law – Hong Kong’s foreign affairs are governed by the Central government. She said she could not comment on the details though the matter would depend on whether the immigration incident involved foreign affairs. Later on during the Q&A session, Civic Party lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki accused Lam of  trying to win popularity with a new public transport subsidy scheme – with a view to introducing politically controversial policies further down the line. The government has pledged to provide 25 per cent of transport expenses over HK$400, subject to a cap of HK$300. Kwok Ka-ki. Photo: HKFP/Catherine Lai. Lam denied she was seeking to buy popularity: “You are underestimating Hong Kong people’s wisdom, if you believe – after providing such considerate care – that the government can implement any policy that the public does not wish for.” Kwok said a member of the public asked him to give HK$300 back to Lam: “They want true ‘One Country, Two Systems,’ true democracy and true universal suffrage.” Lam jokingly replied: “I think that’s bribery. There’s a suspected case of bribery, president.” Kwok left his seat and walked towards Lam in an effort to hand three bank notes to her. But he was halted by security. Shiu Ka-chun.

What is the price for 72 lives?” Over the past two years, 72 students have committed suicide, including two on Thursday.  Comments

Jailed Chinese democracy activist Liu Xiaobo passed away at 5:35pm on Thursday following a battle with liver cancer. Upon news of his death, hundreds of Hongkongers lined up to pay their final respects to him in a vigil outside the China Liaison Office. While the city’s pro-democracy newspapers reported his passing on their front pages on the following day, pro-Beijing newspapers buried the news. Apple Daily: “Murder by a tyrannical regime: Liu Xiaobo passes away”  Ming Pao: “Xiaobo tells Liu Xia to ‘live on well'” The moderate pro-democracy newspaper printed its logo in black and white on Friday.  South China Morning Post: “Tributes and tears for Nobel Peace Laureate”  See also: Hundreds gather at vigil in Hong Kong to mourn Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo Oriental Daily: “Fierce influenza kills 27 in 4 days” The pro-Beijing Oriental Daily mentioned Liu’s passing in its front page, but led with a report on overcrowding at public hospitals due to high rates of influenza.  A detailed story on Liu’s life was presented on page 31.  Wen Wei Po: “Kick out the 4 clowns desecrating the oath: High Court hands down ruling today” Beijing mouthpieces Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao both anticipated Friday afternoon’s scheduled court judgement on the possible disqualification of four pro-democracy lawmakers from the Legislative Council due to the way they took their oaths.  Ta Kung Pao: “Edward Yiu, Nathan Law, Lau Siu-lai and Leung Kwok-hung face disqualification: Judgement this afternoon”  Both Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao, however, published brief reports on Liu’s passing respectively on pages 14 and 4. Ta Kung Pao’s report on Liu’s passing, sourced from Chinese state outlet Xinhua. China Daily: “Xi: China, Canada must enlarge trade” The Chinese State Council-owned China Daily did not report on Liu’s death in Friday’s print edition at all.  The Asian editions of several international publications, such as the Financial Times, covered Liu’s death on their front pages:  See also: China under pressure to free widow of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo  Comments

(Liu Xiaobo) Hong Kong asked to join Chater Garden  tribute   Activists in Hong Kong have called on the public to join an event planned for tomorrow night to pay tribute to Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo. 
The vice chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, Richard Tsoi, said they will gather at Charter Garden at 7pm and march to Beijing’s liaison office in Western. 
Tsoi said 11 years of jail for the Nobel Peace Prize winner over his call for political reform and human rights was "inhuman treatment.'' 
It is not just about human rights on the mainland, Hong Kong people are also worried about the "One Country, Two Systems" principle as Beijing is proving it is not a responsible government, he said. 
The alliance has also set up a book of condolence outside the liaison office for the public to pay their respects to Liu. 
Many Hong Kong residents today paid tribute to Liu and expressed their anger at the authorities' decision not to allow him to travel abroad for treatment.  
After the death of the 61-year-old was announced last night, dozens of people turned up outside the liaison office to pay homage to him.-RTHK Today's Standard

Thousands of spectators filled a stadium in China to watch 10 suspects be sentenced to death for crimes ranging from drug-dealing to homicide before they were taken away to be executed at the weekend. An online video of the rare public trial, held in southern Guangdong province on Saturday, showed the handcuffed suspects paraded around a track by uniformed police officers as onlookers watched from the sidelines. Photo: Weibo. The convicts also stood on a podium as their sentences were read over loudspeakers, while officials sat on a stage flanked by military guards. Rights groups say China executes more people than any other country, but Beijing does not give figures on the death penalty, regarding the statistics as state secrets. A public announcement last week from Lufeng City People’s Court had invited citizens to sit in on the “open-air stadium trial”, as it was dubbed by the state-run Global Times. Beijing News, which circulated the trial video along with several other Chinese media outlets, criticised the court for making a spectacle of the sentences. Ten of 12 suspects were handed the death penalty and taken away for immediate execution while curious locals, including many young people in school uniform, looked on. A middle school in Lufeng posted on Weibo photos of its students attending the event. “Places may hold public trials in order to intimidate criminals and raise society’s sense of security, but they should not violate the basic humanity of the law,” a Beijing News commentary said Monday. The column noted that “from a legal standpoint, the death penalty should not be enacted immediately after the final ruling… the local court deliberately put together this scene for dramatic effect.” According to Global Times, an open-air trial for drug trafficking was also held in Lufeng in 2015, with 10,000 people in the audience. The city is one of the country’s largest producers of methamphetamine.  Comments

Police are investigating a suspected murder-suicide case involving a man and his wife who were found dead after falling from their luxury apartment in Yau Ma Tei in the early hours of Monday, Apple Daily reports. The bodies of Chow Wai-fai, 30, and his wife Fong Yin-ting, 29, were found on the patios of fifth-floor flats at The Coronation at 1 Yau Cheung Road, apparently having plunged from the couple’s rented unit on the 28th floor. Fong’s body had knife wounds to the neck, back and arms. Chief Inspector Lam Chi-yuen of the Yau Tsim District Crime Squad said investigators have yet to confirm whether the knife wounds or the fall was the cause of Fong’s death, but ruled out the possibility of a third party as the door to the flat was locked from the inside. The couple, both civil servants, were married only two years ago after dating for eight years since they met at a part-time job during their university days. Chow was senior foreman at the Eastern District Food and Environmental Hygiene Department while Fong was an information officer at the Information Services Department. Friends and family members said Chow had moved out of their flat last Friday after his wife accused him of having an extramarital affair.  He had been staying at a hotel on Sa Po Road in Kowloon City, and the families of both parties had been notified of their separation. Fong had told her friends that she suspected Chow of having an affair after checking on his phone and had even wanted to hire a private Investigator to gather more evidence, hk01.com reported. Chow is said to have been seeing a university student whom he had met via Instagram. Fong had reportedly told her family that she was thinking of seeking a divorce. At around 4 a.m. on Monday, Chow took a taxi to their apartment in Yau Ma Tei and an argument with his wife ensued, police said.  Chow then must have stabbed his wife, threw her off the balcony, and committed suicide afterward. Officers found a pool of blood and damaged furniture in the living room of the couple’s flat, and a trail of bloody footprints leading to the balcony.  They also found a washed six-inch ceramic knife in the sink, which is suspected to be the murder weapon. Another knife was found inside Chow’s backpack, but there were no notes inside. Police were looking for the taxi driver who took Chow to The Coronation. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Information Services Department have offered their condolences to the families of the couple. – Contact us at [email protected] EL/BN/CG 
A fatal final embrace - Cheating husband stabs wife before grabbing her in double death plunge An unfaithful husband repeatedly stabbed his wife and dragged her to the balcony before embracing her in a deadly leap from the 28th floor of a luxury apartment in Yau Ma Tei, police said. The couple, both civil servants, were found dead in pools of blood - with the woman stabbed on her back, hands and neck - early yesterday morning on the podium of The Coronation, an upmarket  residence, after what police called a fierce fight. Their apartment was a mess, with signs of a fight, pools of blood, bloody footprints and a 15-centimeter ceramic knife. Police classified the tragedy as suspected homicide-suicide. The scorned wife, Tiffany Fong Yin-ting, a 29-year-old government information officer, demanded a divorce after she discovered her husband of two years, Chow Wai-fai, had cheated on her. Chow was a 30-year-old pest unit supervisor in the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department's eastern district. Chow moved out of their rented flat last Friday, but returned to confront his estranged wife yesterday before daybreak. Surveillance footage showed Chow entered the estate's Block 7 alone, and police are now looking for the cab driver who drove him to The Coronation at 1 Yau Cheung Rd. After 5am, the pair fell from the 28B flat to the fifth-floor podium. Police received the call at 6.23am and initially recorded the incident as a fall. Both victims had multiple bone fractures and internal injuries. Police also found trails of blood-red footprints from the couple's living room to the balcony, where the pair fell, indicating a fight had happened. The knife was found in the kitchen, and the woman appeared to have multiple knife wounds on her back, hands and neck. Police did not say if the man had stab wounds. Police had to collect evidence under umbrellas in case crucial forensic information was lost as heavy rain pounded Hong Kong. Yau Tsim Mong Regional Crime Unit is investigating, with West Kowloon Police Tactical Unit assisting. The chief inspector of police of Yau Tsim District, Lam Chi-yuen, said police are investigating in the direction of homicide-suicide. "However, we have yet to work out the exact chronology of the events," Lam said. "No suicide note was found and there was no third person in the apartment." He also appealed to the cab driver who drove Chow from Sa Po Road in Kowloon City to Yan Cheung Road at 4.24am. "The driver or anyone with related information should call us at 3661-9245," Lam said. It is understood that the couple had not been to their offices lately. According to Fong's family, she had snooped her husband's phone when he was showering and found he had been cheating on her. The enraged wife had planned to hire private detectives but eventually decided to divorce Chow and he moved out of the flat last Friday. Chow worked at the FEHD while the wife had worked as a Home Affairs Department information officer before transferring back to the Information Services Department headquarters. Both departments expressed condolences to the families and promised to offer support if needed. "Everyone in ISD is deeply saddened by the news," an ISD spokeswoman said. "We will offer counselling to colleagues if necessary."  People feeling emotionally troubled should seek help from suicide- prevention center Samaritans at 2389-2222. Today's Standard

Another shop cat may be “detained” by the authorities after it was accused of hurting a woman, following a similar incident earlier in the week Democratic Party lawmaker Roy Kwong said he learnt of the new case on Thursday, whereby a woman mistakenly stepped on the cat’s tail at a pharmacy in Sha Tin. The cat screeched and scratched the woman, although there was no bleeding from the wound. A pharmacy staff member was willing to treat the customer’s wound but she refused and left. A few hours later, the woman returned with her family and reported the incident to the police. Kwong said the woman refused to go to hospital when an ambulance arrived. The Sha Tin pharmacy cat. Photo: Roy Kwong. It came after a similar incident this week in which the Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) tried to take away a shop cat accused of hurting a child. It later accepted that the cat could stay at a private clinic under observation after over 60,000 people signed a petition in one day. Following the new incident, a representative of the AFCD arrived at the Sha Tin pharmacy on Friday afternoon, saying that the cat will not be taken away for now, and officials will be sent to the pharmacy in seven days to observe the feline’s situation. However, the AFCD contacted the pharmacy later and said that it has to take the pet away within seven days in accordance with its rules. “Why give the cat a hard time?” Kwong said. “Cats don’t usually actively assault people – from security footage, the cat used its paws out of instinct because of the pain of its tail being stepped on – it did not intentionally hurt people.” “I cannot understand why the AFCD turned back on its promise that the cat can stay under observation at the pharmacy,” he said, adding that it was sick and under examination at a clinic. Roy Kwong. Photo: Democratic Party. Kwong said both incidents show that education concerning animals is not carried out well enough in Hong Kong, causing misunderstandings or even hatred of animals. He said the Education Bureau and the government should increase public education regarding the correct way of handling animals.  Comments

Dubai says Indian movie icon's death an accident Dubai investigators closed the case on Tuesday into the death last weekend of Indian movie icon Sridevi, calling it an accidental drowning. Her family has been given permission to take her body back to India, officials said. 
The 54-year-old Sridevi, who was known by only one name, drowned in a hotel bathtub after losing consciousness, officials say. Police officials in Dubai have said the autopsy also revealed alcohol in her system. 
"The case has now been closed,” the state-run Dubai Media office tweeted. 
Her death has been front-page news in India, where Bollywood stars command an almost-mythical status. Fans have been gathering in front of the Mumbai home of her brother-in-law, the prominent actor Anil Kapoor. 
The coverage has been both lurid and restrained, with one TV station showing a reporter talking about her death from inside a bathtub, and many newspapers not even mentioning the alcohol reports. 
Indian media reported that Anil Ambani, a wealthy Mumbai-based industrialist, dispatched a private plane to Dubai to carry Sridevi’s body back home. It was not immediately clear when that would happen. 
Sridevi was the most famous Bollywood actress of the 1980s and ’90s, and the first woman to get top billing in an industry then completely dominated by men. Starting out as a child star in south Indian regional movies, she became known as an adult for her impeccable comic timing as well as her dancing skills — a serious asset in a country where song-and-dance melodramas are a movie staple. -AP

The Correctional Services Department said on Monday that a committee will review a case whereby a person in custody attempted to commit suicide by hanging. The case involved a 28-year-old male at Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre, remanded on charges of rape. He was prevented from acting by correctional officers. “At 8.01am today, a correctional officer found the person in custody hanging with bed sheet tied to the window frame inside the toilet of a dayroom. The officer immediately called for reinforcements and provided first aid treatment to him,” a press release said. Staff at the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre. File Photo: Apple Daily. “The person in custody was found unconscious at that moment and was subsequently sent to a public hospital for further treatment. The case has been reported to the Police.” A spokesman for the department said: “The department uses all possible measures to prevent people in its custody from attempting suicide or self-harm. These measures include administrative arrangements, the improvement of institution facilities, staff training and first aid services.” The department told HKFP that a committee led by a senior superintendent of correctional services will review the incident. It said it will not comment on individual cases since the incident has been transferred to the police for investigation. Tuen Mun case The public broadcaster RTHK cited sources as saying that the man was the suspect detained in a case last month, in which a 30-year-old woman living alone at Po Tin Estate in Tuen Mun was followed by a man and raped at her flat. The police arrested a 28-year-old man in Mong Kok in mid-June, and he was detained at the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre awaiting trial. Sau Mau Ping police station. File Photo: Apple Daily. In May, a 48-year-old man accused of robbing and raping a woman in Kowloon Bay hanged himself at the Sau Mau Ping police station. Apple Daily cited sources as saying that the suspect used a computer network cable from a desk. The police chief has said that the force has arranged officers from another region to investigate the suicide.

“Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.” “Share for good luck.” With the rise of mobile messaging applications over the past few years, older generations of Hongkongers have discovered a new way of communicating with younger family members. Many frequently send good wishes, words of wisdom and even random trivia – printed in colourful but outdated fonts – overlaid on top of simple images of flowers or religious symbols. Photo: Hong Kong Elder Graphics Association via Facebook. Known as “elder graphics,” the messages have become popular not only in Hong Kong, but also Taiwan and mainland China. While their origins are unclear, media reports have suggested that they were the product of computer lessons for adults and seniors, which taught the use of simple software. Older people with eyesight problems may also find emojis – which are more popular among young people – too small to use. Some of them function like chain e-mails from the early days of the internet, often asking recipients to share the message infinitely “if they agree” or “for good luck.” As such, on occasions such as Lunar New Year or the Mid-Autumn Festival, people may find their mobile phones flooded with images, using up large amounts of data allowance. In response, some young people have transformed elder graphics into a form of satire. Graphics that have gone viral on local internet forum Golden include pointless messages, such as “the death rate from drinking water is 100 per cent,” or “in Africa, every 60 seconds, one minute passes.” “According to a study from the UK… the death rate from drinking water is 100 per cent.” Political satire However, in Hong Kong, where there has been a generational shift in values and opinions, satire is largely political. Matthew, a first year university student, told HKFP he started following political affairs in 2012, after the government attempted to force a controversial national education syllabus in schools across Hong Kong. In March 2016, he created his first elder graphic image using an application on his mobile phone. That month, pro-establishment lawmaker Elizabeth Quat Pui-fan had shocked her colleagues after misspeaking at a Legislative Council session while discussing a string of 20 suicides by Hong Kong students in the previous year. “Actually, with student suicides, even one case is too few,” she said, before correcting herself and apologising. “20 students. Even one is too much.” Photo: Hong Kong Elder Graphics Association via Facebook. Matthew’s reply read: “20 students. Even one is too much. Dear government, when will you stop?” As with traditional elder graphics, the words were overlaid on top of an image of the Buddha, and asked recipients to “share if they agree.” He soon created the satirical Facebook page Hong Kong Elder Graphics Association, which now has 18,000 followers. As the creator behind most of the 600 graphics posted on the page, he has satirised every political event ranging from Beijing’s interpretation of the Basic Law to disqualify two pro-independence lawmakers, to the “Lead Water” scandal where supplies at housing estates were found to contain the heavy metal. During last year’s Legislative Council elections, a Stand News blogger also created a series of elder graphics, aiming to persuade older, pro-establishment family members to cast their votes for the opposition camp. Across the strait in Taiwan, internet users have recently made elder graphics in support of legalising same-sex marriage, a move which is currently being debated in parliament. “Did you know? Less than 40% of primary schools in Hong Kong use Cantonese to teach Chinese.” Photo: Hong Kong Elderly Graphics Association via Facebook. Matthew says that his older relatives read his satirical memes, and are sometimes able to better understand his political views through them. But mostly, they are ambivalent towards the images: “Yeah they see them, but all they do is laugh.” “But my internet friends have all started calling me ‘elder’,” he joked.  Comments

Barrister drowns on hike Stella Wong Well-known barrister Albert Poon Ying-yin died while hiking yesterday, the third fatality in the past 15 days.  Poon, 53, drowned in the sea near Yau Chau Tong Marine Park in Tai Po during a hike near Red Stone Gate. Poon's death comes after a 69-year-old man died after slipping off a steep slope at Kau Nga Ling on Lantau Island on November 26. Three days later, a 48-year-old woman fell from "suicide cliff" on Kowloon Peak. Poon was hiking with friends at about2pmyesterday when they spotted an island with breathtaking scenery. They decided to take the opportunity of the fine weather and swim to the island. However, things took a turn for the worse when Poon encountered difficulties half way to the island. He attempted to swim back to shore but failed. He then tried calling for help, but drowned in the sea.  Poon's friends dragged him back to the shore and called the police. The unconscious Poon was airlifted to the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital by helicopter, but was certified deadtwo hours later. Poon began his career as a barrister in Hong Kong in 1990. He worked at Sir Oswald Cheung's Chambers, which is headed by renowned barrister Edward Chan King-sang. The chamber had 58 members, including ex-lawmaker Audrey Eu Yuet-mee and former Communications Authority chairman Ambrose Ho Pui-him. Poon specialized in criminal cases. In 2009, he was the lawyer for Chan Wai-hang, the first defendant who made blackmail threats to the wife and mother of the former chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties Walter Kwok Ping-sheung. Chan had demanded HK$400 million.  Two defendants were convicted of conspiracy to blackmail and were sentenced to 10 years in jail. Poon was married, but did not have children. His younger sister, Irene Poon, is a prosecutor at the Department of Justice. Yan Chau Tong Marine Park is on the northeast coast of Plover Cove Country Park. The area is dubbed "Mini Kweilin" in Hong Kong, as hikers can find a wide variety of land forms, including bays, peninsulas, rock cliffs, sand pits and beaches. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Observatory has warned people to expect another chilly weekend as temperaturesnext Sunday andMondaywill drop to 13 degree Celsius.  The second successive weekend of cold weather comes after the mercury dipped to 13.3 degreeson Saturday. The Observatory attributed the cold weather to another northeast monsoon, which is expected to affect the South China coast. The weather today will be fine and dry, with temperatures ranging from 15 to 20 degrees.  The temperature will range between 17 and 21 degrees from Tuesday to Thursday, but cloudy weather is expected on all three days.  However, the mercury will hit 22 degrees on Friday before falling to 15 degreeson Saturday. In the following two days, temperatures will hover between 13 to 18 degrees.  stellast.wong@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

Social media giant Facebook rolled out its suicide prevention service in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Users can report to Facebook when they spot messages that may indicate a friend is at risk. Facebook will then reach out to the reported individual to provide help. Once the report is received, Facebook will assess the risk of self-harm or suicide. A pop-up window will enquire about their wellbeing and present three methods of assistance: “talking with friend”, “contact a helpline” and “get tips and support.” Facebook providing help for individuals at risk of chronic depressive mood, self-harm or suicide. Photo: Facebook Safety, via Facebook. Users who request a helpline in the Hong Kong region will be referred to The Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong through phone, email or text message. The NGO told HKFP that their service is provided in “mostly Cantonese.” Users who select “tips or support” will be advised to take a deep breath, have a stroll outside, exercise, express creativity through drawing or write down their feelings. “We have teams working around the world, 24/7, who review reports that come in,” an announcement on the Facebook Safety page read. “They prioritize the most serious reports like self-injury.” Facebook providing three alternative ways to seek help, namely “talking with friend”, “contact helpline” and receive “tips or support”. Photo: Screenshot from Facebook. Paul Yip Siu-fai, director of The Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre of Suicide Research and Prevention, told Ming Pao that some students elude to suicidal ideation on social media before taking their own life. He urged netizens not to take signs of people seeking help lightly, while recommending that the public listen to the needs of those in distress and introduce them to professional help. The Education Bureau set up a committee early this year after receiving over 20 reports of student suicides since September, 2015. A public rally entitled “I want to live” was held in March to encourage young people to treasure life after seven incidents of student suicides were recorded within nine days in the same month. Participants also called for the resignation of Secretary for Education, Eddie Ng Hak-kim. If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255. The Hong Kong Society of Counseling and Psychology provides a WhatsApp hotline in English and Chinese: 6218 1084.  Comments
