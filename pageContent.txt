
Heartbreaking article the other week about examination stress. Apparently since the Diploma of Secondary Education came into full flowering in 2012 about 71 students in the relevant age group have eluded the examiners by killing themselves. The writer, who still had fresh memories of passing the ordeal herself, thought this was shocking, and so do I. It is always difficult to be sure of the motives of people who commit suicide, and there is a tendency for one reported case to inspire imitation. Even so, I remember the days when a toll of one or two suicides in an examination season was considered bad news. We are now, it seems, running a rate of something over ten a year.

That is to say, your final score depends entirely on the two weeks of frantic writing at the end of the course. There is no credit for school work done earlier. She also noted that in Hong Kong the DSE was practically the only input used by universities in admissions decision-making. That, I can confirm, is certainly the case. When four-year degrees arrived, the committee of university heads decided (this was not a necessary feature of the new system) to abandon the old arrangement by which a course selected its own students. In future admission would be by faculty or school. This means that anyone working on admissions is faced with a crowd of thousands from whom they have to pick a hundred or two. No detailed consideration is possible. The exam score is effectively all there is. The only other indicator of any interest is the student’s choice. I remember several attempts to float scoring systems for extra-curricular activities, with bonus points ranging from – say – one for doing a Red Cross flag day up to ten for an Olympic medal. None of these came out as very convincing and I don’t think anyone is using one now. There is also the familiar point that a university degree means less now than it did in the days when it was a rarity. The unfortunate consequence of this is that employers who really do not need people with a university degree still use it as a way of reducing their pool of applicants to a manageable size.

This leads to the suspicion that – as one of Michael Moore’s interviewees puts it in Bowling for Columbine – if you don’t graduate you will die poor and lonely. Your future – not to mention your parents’ happiness – is at stake in the DSE and failure to meet expectations is a major personal catastrophe. I do not, I must say, remember similar angst over the corresponding examinations through which I plodded many years ago. The writing was all done in two or three weeks – continuous assessment had not been invented – and we had to do the whole thing twice (it was called O and A Levels). It may be that as a sort of supergeek for whom examinations came easily I missed symptoms of tension in my classmates. But there is not much privacy in a boarding school. Then maybe we were let off the hook by the 11 plus. This was an exam (which was supposed to be a mere “IQ test”) taken at the end of primary education. It may have caused some stress, but most of us were too young to take it that seriously, and at least the stress did not coincide with teenage turmoil. Those who took the exam were then allocated either to Grammar Schools (this outcome was familiarly described as “passed”) or to Secondary Modern Schools, which were noticeably less affluent and prestigious (“failed”). There was supposed to be a third category of Technical Schools for the NCOs of industry, but few of these actually appeared. Everyone in my school had, by definition, “passed” the 11 plus. So we may subconsciously have thought that we already had Business Class tickets for the 747 of life. Getting into university was still very unusual. For most of us it was hoped for but not expected. Perhaps, raised on the stories of our parents’ privations in World War Two, we set the bar for complaints a bit higher than it is set now. Employers, anyway, rarely insisted on a degree. Many professions which now require a degree, including the Law and journalism, still admitted most of their recruits fresh from school. The University of Hong Kong. Photo: 马克爱生活 via flickr. This absence of stress at school was more than compensated by a surplus at university. The one I attended offered an idyllic existence for three years. You then had a week of “Finals” which was rather reminiscent of that legendary Chinese examination in which candidates for the civil service were shut up in a room for a week and told to write down all they knew. We had six hours of exams on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Sunday off, six hours on Monday and a last burst on Tuesday morning, after which there was an understandable tendency for the exhausted examinee to get resoundingly drunk. An oddity I noticed on arrival was that all student rooms had brand new electric fires. This was because the university had decreed, after a spate of student suicides using gas, that all gas fires should be replaced with something less obviously lethal.  This was a success. Nobody killed him or herself while I was there. Some people continued to get special dispensation to take their Finals in the local mental hospital. In small colleges there was constant vigilance. I remember the Dean of my place, seeing me sitting on the steps of a church (I was waiting for a friend) drew disturbing conclusions about my state of mind. He stopped his car in the middle of the street, ignored the ensuing hoots of outrage from other motorists and ran across to ask if I was alright. At the University of London I heard of an odious arrangement in some of the more sought-after science programmes. They would admit about 20 per cent more students to the first year than they had places for in the laboratory subjects which started in the second. At the end of the first year the bottom 20 per cent in the pecking order were simply expelled. The results of this can be imagined. One of my first attempts at journalism was a column in a student publication at the University of Lancaster drawing attention to two recent attempts at suicide (both, fortunately, half-hearted and unsuccessful) and wondering if exam stress could be reduced as this seemed to be a cause.

I then got a polite hand-written letter from the Vice Chancellor saying that he was willing to try anything, but reducing the significance of exams appeared to be not so much a way of reducing stress as a way of spreading it over a longer period. We discussed the matter further and agreed that a student counselling service was a good idea. As I was the student union president at the time this proposal was sure of a favourable wind from several directions and materialised rather quickly. I do not know if it helped. And this gets us back to where we started. Yes, the DSE is a stressful experience which some victims do not survive. But what would help? I suppose there is no practical objection to spreading the exams over, say, four weeks instead of two. Would that reduce stress or spread it out? Using continuous assessment of school work is a big ask because it puts teachers in a complicated situation. How much help is permissible; how much benevolent marking do their pastoral obligations require? It seems also that while the student whose continuous assessment is successful can comfort himself with the thought that he enters the exam room with some money in the bank, as it were, the student who is less successful in term time may find the exam an even more onerous and frightening ordeal than if he was allowed to start from scratch. Students taking Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (DSE). Photo: HKEAA. Counselling can help, and a lot of people now offer it. I fear those who most need it are the least likely to ask. The unlikely reform which I think would help is giving more thought to the idea that the entire student population should take the same exam. The consequence of this is a large group of candidates entering the examination room knowing that their chances of passing are minimal or non-existent. A further large group in the same boat may not realise this until they see the actual questions. When I took the French Oral exam (a one-to-one chat with visiting examiner) we were admitted in alphabetical order. The first person out was besieged by an eager crowd asking what the examiner had wanted to talk about. Unfortunately this boy was not a strong candidate. “I don’t know,” he said, “she was talking in a foreign language.” Seriously, though, the business of preparing people for an arbitrary and unnecessary encounter with failure is gratuitously cruel. There may be something in the idea that those who aspire to life’s glittering prizes should be willing to suck it up and tough it out on occasion. The rest of us do not need to be prepared for a seat at the back of the bus. Life will provide us with as many examples of failure and rejection as a sane person needs. We do not need an extra dollop from the education system.

By Heidy Lo DSE. Three letters that strike fear into every Hong Kong student and cause debilitating anxiety. As someone who has experienced the DSE and who now works as a tutor for this year’s cohort, I want to reflect on this destructively stressful examination and its long-term effects. With this year’s exams starting, we need to raise awareness of the tremendous pressure Hong Kong students are under and be mindful of its dangers. Photo: Stand News. Hong Kong’s Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) – the public examination students take in the final year of secondary school – is among the most high-pressure exams in the world. The DSE has a relatively low coursework element and less flexibility – compared with the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the AS and A2 Level exams in the UK – so the fate of students comes down to the final two weeks of exams rather than the pressure being spread throughout the year. Furthermore, university entry requirements in Hong Kong are almost solely DSE-based, drawing a straight connection between the DSE and future employability that cranks up the pressure on students even further. According to the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the unemployment rate was 2.5 percent in January 2017 for people with a BA degree, while it is more than double that for those without one. For prestigious universities like HKU, the graduate employment rate has been close to 100 per cent for over a decade. With the DSE as the only gateway to these vital qualifications, the pressure is enormous. This can have disastrous consequences. Since 2013, the second year of the DSE, about 71 students have committed suicide. For students, there are immense stress levels and various forms of mental illness. During the last months of secondary school, work piles up, extra lessons and tutor classes take up all free time and expectations from various angles suffocate the students. Fear of missing out without a “superstar tutor” adds further worry. At the same time, tutors like Billy Ng expect students to deal with it all, saying things like: “Young people just have to get over the pressure. That’s life.” One student from this year’s cohort described the pressure they are under as “so overwhelming that I was unable to catch my breath.” A protest raising awareness of student suicides. Photo: Albert Chan. A former DSE student myself, I remember those final exams as the worst time of my life. I became depressed, suffered from high levels of stress and I can now see that my teenage self was unable to handle this stress, combined with all the other emotions of being a young person. Expectations from my family, friends, teachers, classmates and from myself pushed me close to the edge. I became unable to eat, I suffered from chronic insomnia and I closed myself off socially. I am not a social person by nature, but due to the pressure of the DSE I essentially became mute. Though I still interacted with people superficially, I never talked about my feelings and felt I should not do so because there was nothing unique about my experience: everyone was going through the same thing. After finishing the DSE, I thought I had recovered from the ordeal but even now in times of high pressure my body can revert to the intense fight or flight mode created by the DSE and the negative symptoms can reappear. The intense stress of the DSE period has a potentially traumatic effect that can remain with students long after the event. In the long term, changes must be made in universities’ entry requirements and in the DSE system itself to ease the pressure on students. In the meantime, we may have to settle for raising awareness of the pressures involved in this uniquely traumatic exam, and paying careful attention to those going through the process in the next two months.

Guidance counselors say their role not replaceable Social workers should not replace counseling teachers, an alliance of school councilors said, after the government advocated posting a social worker to each school. The alliance, which represents student guidance teachers, said its members had been told by the Education Bureau that teachers should go back to their posts so their counseling function can be taken up by social workers. Counseling teachers and social workers should co-exist, the alliance said. Speaking on a radio program, teachers' group member Ho Lai-har, said: "Why do we have to replace each other? To make things work, they (social workers) have to cooperate with teachers." Ho said about 20 percent of primary schools in Hong Kong have student guidance teachers, which means a total of 120.  Besides counseling, counseling teachers are also responsible for coordinating different departments to arrange activities for students. They also offer student support and life education, while also handling their cases. "Our advantages are we are stable in schools, and we have the chance to learn every student's needs," Ho said.  Ho said posting one social worker to each primary school confuses teachers. They will welcome the policy only if counseling teachers' roles are not made redundant. She said their main concern is not just to "keep their jobs" but to ensure that counseling teachers help children with problems like child abuse. These issues cannot be resolved by just having a social worker in each school. She said many schools with child abuse cases do not have any guidance teachers at all.  "Over the past few years, the government has been more flexible in granting funds. But were those funds put in the right places? Have the funds been used appropriately?" Ho said.  "Why don't we let good teams work together to serve children when there are ample fiscal reserves anyway," she said. Anthony Wong Kin-wai, business director at the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, said suicides among students has been a serious issue in recent years.  sophie.hui@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

Lau Ming-wai, vice chairman of the Youth Development Commission (YDC), said it would be unrealistic for the public to expect the newly established agency to deal with sensitive political issues such as why young people want Hong Kong to be independent. Lau said such issues concern not only the youth but society as a whole, and they are best addressed by the central government, SAR government and Legislative Council, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports. Even if the YDC supports the relaunch of political reform, for example, there is no way that the commission will take charge of the issue, he said. On March 28 the government announced that the Commission on Youth would be upgraded into the YDT, with Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung as chairman. The purpose of the revamp is to promote youth development in a more holistic manner, address young people’s concerns about education, career and home ownership, involve them more in public policy discussion and debate, and encourage them to participate in politics. However, Senia Ng Sze-nok, a barrister and YDC member of the Democratic Party, wants the commission to look into the reasons why many young people are calling for Hong Kong independence or self-determination. Lau, chairman of Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd., considers it more realistic for the YDC to focus on preventing students from committing suicide than dealing with political issues such as self-determination. Lau also criticized political figures for paying “fake” attention to the youth, noting that few candidates in elections over the past two years had really shown that they cared for the youth and wanted to help them develop themselves so they could move up the social ladder. On the other hand, Lau thinks many young people do not really approve of political figures or parties and they cast their votes just to prevent a candidate whose beliefs are opposite theirs from getting elected. This low degree of approval among the youth is a major hindrance to the government’s goal of involving young people in politics, Lau said. As such, addressing this problem is one of the commission’s priorities, he said. Lau said it is a fact that a generation gap exists between people aged 50 or above and young people. That being the case, Lau urged YDC chairman Matthew Cheung and the other eight members who are senior government officials to make more effort to understand what young people are thinking through their participation in the commission’s affairs. – Contact us at [email protected] TL/BN/CG 
[This article contains images some readers may find distressing] A Hong Kong kindergarten attended by a five-year-old who reportedly died after being found unconscious at home was aware of multiple bruises suffered by the girl months before her tragic death, according to photos taken by teachers and obtained by FactWire. Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said in a press release on 10 January that it had opened an investigation to look into the case. Photo: Factwire. On 6 January, Chan Sui-lam was rushed to hospital covered in bruises but was declared dead on arrival. Her 26-year-old father and 27-year-old stepmother were arrested and subsequently charged with murder two days later. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. Vivian Yu Mei-ying, principal of Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery in Tuen Mun, told reporters at the time that the kindergarten did not find any injuries on the girl before Sui-lam quit the school in late October. Vivian Yu Mei-ying, principal of Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery in Tuen Mun, did not respond to any questions from reporters. Photo: Factwire. However, dozens of images obtained by FactWire have raised questions over that claim and whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy. The two sets of photos, including 19 images taken on 5 September and seven on 25 September, show a number of bruises all over her body, including on both of her arms, hands, legs and feet. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. The first set of photos includes one showing a badly swollen right palm, while photos in the second set show bruise marks across her right cheek and a scabbed wound on her left. Multiple sources have verified the photos and confirmed they were taken by teachers at the kindergarten. One whistleblower told FactWire that Yu, the principal, explicitly told teachers to photograph the bruises when they were first spotted. The source added that teachers had later submitted a report, which was signed by Yu and accompanied with photographs, documenting the details of Sui-lam’s injuries found on 5 and 25 September. Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said in a press release on 10 January that it had opened an investigation to look into the case. Photo: Factwire. Injuries found on other occasions, include red marks and peeling skin on her ear, were not included in the report, said another source. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. Sui-lam had stopped attending school on 27 October and was officially withdrawn from the kindergarten in December. Her case was also reported to the preschool’s supervisor around that time, according to a source close to the operator Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. But speaking to reporters two days after her death, Yu insisted the school had found no injuries on the girl and therefore never filed any injury report with the Education Bureau nor the Social Welfare Department. She added that teachers would have noticed the bruises because pupils were wearing short-sleeve uniforms in September. Chan Sui-lam. Photo: Factwire. Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said in a press release on 10 January that it took allegations that the school was previously alerted of the situation very seriously and had opened an investigation to look into the matter. ‘The service has promised it would invite the relevant departments and independent parties to join in the investigation whenever appropriate,’ the statement said. The organisation has yet to release findings from its internal probe. Yu has just returned to work last Wednesday after taking a leave of absence after the incident. She did not respond to any questions about Sui-lam’s case at the kindergarten yesterday. The Reverend Daniel Li Yat-shing, the kindergarten’s supervisor and first vice-president of the Lutheran Church Hong Kong Synod, also declined to comment on whether the church knew about the injuries before the girl’s death, citing ongoing legal proceedings.

In an email response on Tuesday morning, a spokesperson for Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said: ‘The service would like to express our sorrow and sympathy at the passing of a pupil from Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery. We have collected information about her situation at school before her death and have handed that information to the police. ‘Based on legal advice, we would not take any actions that may affect the ongoing court proceedings.’ Photos taken by teachers on September 5 show Sui-lam’s bruises.

Schools fail yet again in abuse watch Two boys who were allegedly abused by their mother told teachers they were injured after fighting with one another. It is the second instance where a school failed to detect a suspected child abuse case, after five-year-old Chan Sui-lam died in January following suspected abuse.  The two, aged eight and 10, appeared in a video which went viral on the internet over the weekend. The clip shows one boy with his hands tied up outside a toilet, and another boy being hit by his mother in a playground. The brothers are Primary Three and Five students in the ELCHK Faith Lutheran School in Shek Kip Mei.  The school's principal Leung So-wan said that teachers noticed red marks on their faces. But, when asked what happened, the boys said the injuries were from fighting with each other. She said the incident happened after school at the brothers' home. Asked if the brothers had told the school about their mother hitting them, Leung said they "did not ask help from us". She described the brothers as normal children who were not absentees at school. Their father used to take them to school when they were smaller, but now they go on their own.  The principal said the school had activated its crisis management mechanism, and it had met after finding out about the incident.  She said the Education Bureau and the Social Welfare Department were also keeping tabs.  Leung also said teachers and staff of the school would check with the students and parents on finding any suspicious injuries on children.  It is the second instance of a school failing to detect a suspected child abuse case. Last month, media reported that there were photographs showing that the Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery in Tuen Mun was aware that five-year-old Chan Sui-lam was being abused months before her death. Meanwhile, the mother yesterday denied abusing the two boys, and said she loved her children. She told local media that the footage was made by a man who sexually harassed her. She believed the man uploaded the clip on the internet in order to damage the relationship between her and her sons.  However, police arrested the 41-year-old mother, Cheung, on suspicion of ill-treatment or neglect by those in charge of child or young person, in Shek Kip Mei Estate.  After initial investigations, police said the woman in the clip allegedly abused her sons in middle of last year.  The woman also has a five-year-old daughter, who was being sent to the hospital for a check-up with the brothers.  Lawmakers also raised concerns over child abuse cases in Legco yesterday.  Police said they handled 1,400 criminal cases relating to family violence last year. However, Labour Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung said the government had failed to analyze the trend of domestic violence.  He asked if the government would consider implementing a compulsory notification mechanism for frontline professionals to report cases of suspected abuse.  sophie.hui@singtaonewscorp.com Today's Standard

As one of his first official acts as President of the United States, Donald Trump picked up the congratulatory call from his Taiwanese colleague Tsai Ing-wen. With this call, the small state with a population of 24 million enraged the mighty People’s Republic of China. There, this diplomatic appreciation of the tiny island off its shore was read as no less than an infringement on its own sovereignty. The dispute behind these procedures is seventy years old: while the Communist Party of China considers Taiwan to be an integral part of its territory, many Taiwanese citizens beg to disagree. In the aftermath of the Chinese civil war, from which Mao’s Communists emerged victoriously, the members of the defeated Kuomintang Party regrouped in Taiwan, hoping to reclaim mainland China from the Communists in due course. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen speaks on the phone with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump at her office in Taipei, Taiwan, in this handout photo made available December 3, 2016. Photo: Taiwan Presidential Office/Handout via Reuters. First, however, they transformed the island into a one-party dictatorship, alike that of the Communists bordering on their shores. The older generations of Taiwanese still recall these days of the ‘White Terror’. While Mao thus proclaimed the People’s Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek declared the Republic of China of Taiwan. Both claimed to represent the singular, real China. After Chiang’s death in 1975, liberalisations began in Taiwan that paved the road for the first free parliamentary elections in 1992. The Kuomintang, who remained in power for the first few legislative cycles, became the advocates for a peaceful reunification with China. The ‘One China’ doctrine, to which Peking regularly appeals until today, dates back to these days. Nonetheless, both sides have not since stepped back from their claim to represent this ‘One China’. As diplomatic ties developed between Taiwan and the US, Taiwan was guaranteed its special status. However, the incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, is chairwoman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Her election in 2016 alarmed Peking, as reunification is no topic for the DPP. It is Taiwan’s young generation that brought the DPP to power. This generation neither has an interest in a reissue of a conflict between two war parties that dates back to 1949, nor does it feel any allegiance to the inheritance of mainland China. They consider themselves to be Taiwanese. The more radical of them took to the streets in the 2014 Sunflower-Movement, successfully squatting Parliament to prevent the Kuomintang from granting China more economic, and thus political, influence on the island. Today, five of these ‘radicals’ are Members of Parliament. Photo: Taiwan Presidential Office Flickr. That is a fortune denied to their counterparts in nearby Hong Kong. There, the protagonists of the student movements were sentenced to jail. The PRC shows little concern for contracts that guaranteed to respect Hong Kong’s democratic culture of the country. The People’s Republic, encouraged by its economic success to export its autocratic political model, has lately held the reins more tightly on Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Chinese intrusion in Hong Kong’s democracy has also sparked fears on Taiwan. The future of democracy will thus be decided in Taiwan. US Congress lately acknowledged this and appreciated Taiwan diplomatically. The technocratic ‘Taiwan Travel Act’ allows, up to the ministerial level, US diplomatic visits to Taipei and vice versa. China is, yet again, enraged. The Communist superpower watches with eagle’s eyes that no terms are publicly used that could signal the independence of Taiwan. In this pursuit, airlines and hotels were pressured to delete Taiwan as an independent country option on their websites. German giant Lufthansa followed suit and joined the sad ranks of Daimler, whose CEO Dieter Zetsche sucked up to Peking after a quote of the Dalai Lama had surfaced on the company’s social media channels. Tibet, too, is considered part of its territory by the PRC. German corporates, to protect their market shares, are in cahoots with the authoritarian regime, humiliating the Federal Republic of Germany and debasing European values.  It is thus invigorating to see the US Congress stand up to the behaviour of the PRC. The German Bundestag should follow suit and strengthen its bonds with Taiwan and Hong Kong, given that they, together with the democracies of South Korea and Japan, are the West’s allies in the region. These are the countries that feature freedom of opinion, press, and religion. Taiwan will introduce marriage equality coined in the Western example as the first Asian state. Meanwhile, China has sounded the attack on the Western, democratic and open system. In this struggle of the systems, China is certainly no enemy of the West as Russia was during the Cold War: the country does not aim for military expansion. Yet, it is uncompromising in its economic strategy to expand its sphere of influence across the globe through ingenious investments, and thereby become an antipole of the free world order established and guaranteed by the US after the Second War.

Hong Kong police arrested a 19-year-old man after he admitted killing his girlfriend when they traveled to Taiwan last month. The body of the victim, Poon Hiu-wing, 20, a student at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education, was found in a plastic bag that was dumped in a grassy area near the Taipei Metro Zhuwei station by Taiwan police, Apple Daily reports. Police investigation revealed that the man, surnamed Chan, an associate degree student from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and Poon went to Taiwan on Feb. 7 for a 10-day trip. The two spent a few days in Kaohsiung city in southern Taiwan before going to Taipei to celebrate Valentine’s Day on Feb. 14. Poon had told her family she would return home on Feb. 17, the second day of the Lunar New Year. When she did not come back days after that, the family called Poon’s phone number but nobody picked up the calls. On March 5, Poon’s mother approached Hong Kong police for assistance. Later, Poon’s father learned that Chan returned to Hong Kong alone on Feb. 17. He then went to ask him where she was, and was told by Chan that they had separated after a quarrel and he had never seen her since. Officers of the missing persons unit of the Kowloon East Region police district questioned Chan and found him in possession of Poon’s ATM card. Chan admitted that he used it to withdraw NT$20,000 (US$683) on Feb.17 and HK$8,500 (US$1,084) on Feb. 20. On Sunday, Poon’s father flew to Taipei to seek assistance from local police, who later confirmed Chan left the hotel alone on the morning of Feb. 17, carrying a pink suitcase, and returned to the hotel in the evening without it.  After receiving a request from their Taiwanese counterparts to follow up the case, Hong Kong police located Chan on Tuesday and questioned him at the Tseung Kwan O Police Station. It is understood that Chan admitted under interrogation that he killed his girlfriend and put her body in a luggage. It is not clear what motivated him to kill Poon. Chan went to an area near the Taipei Metro Zhuwei station in Tamsui district, where he dumped the body of the victim wrapped in plastic, police said. He left the suitcase in Zhongshan district. Police said Chan was arrested for theft in connection with Poon’s ATM card, and not for the killing, which happened in Taiwan. Hong Kong and Taiwan have no extradition agreement. On Wednesday morning Taiwanese forensics staff collected evidence at the scene. Officers were to conduct an autopsy of the body in the afternoon to confirm the cause of death. – Contact us at [email protected] TL/JC/CG 
Social welfare sector lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun has hit out at Chief Executive Carrie Lam for neglecting to mention the problem of student suicides in her policy address. During a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Council on Thursday, Shiu told Lam that there were two instances of suicide and attempted suicide earlier that day. A CUHK student was taken to the hospital around 2am after a suspected suicide attempt, and an 11-year-old boy in school uniform died after falling from a building in Tai Po, according to Ming Pao and RTHK.

What is the price of 72 lives?… Under what circumstances will you properly and solemnly respond to the problem of youth suicides, and host a summit on youth suicides? It’s only by respecting death that you can respect life,” Shiu said. In response, Lam said that there was “no need to use such emotional language,” and added that she started being concerned about youth suicides when she was the Director of Social Welfare. “If you ask Professor Paul Yip, who has done the most research on suicides in Hong Kong, I have long demonstrated concern over the issue and in order to facilitate his research, I have requested that departments make numbers available to him.” Shiu Ka-chun holding a list of dates on which students committed suicide.

She also said that she does not recall any requests for a summit, but promised to ask the Secretary for Labour and Welfare to follow up. Earlier this year, concern groups petitioned Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, urging him to hold a summit on youth suicides. Lam stressed that “the government cares a lot about mental health issues, especially those relating to young people.” Her policy address did not mention student suicides specifically, but it said: “Based on the evaluation results of the Student Mental Health Support Pilot Scheme, we will consider ways to provide appropriate support services for students with mental health needs.” If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255.

Hong Kong authorities want to extradite a 19-year-old local man to Taiwan to face justice after killing his girlfriend and stuffing her body in a suitcase during a trip to the island last month. The suspect, surnamed Chan, an associate degree student from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, admitted during interrogation by Hong Kong police on Tuesday that he killed his girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, 20, a student at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education, and stuffed her body in a suitcase which he later dumped near a metro station in Taipei. However, Chan was only charged with two counts of theft and one count of handling stolen goods after he confessed using Poon’s ATM card to withdraw NT$20,000 (US$683) in Taiwan on Feb. 17 and HK$8,500 (US$1,084) in Hong Kong on Feb. 20. That’s because the killing happened in Taiwan, which does not have an extradition agreement with Hong Kong. Even if Chan is tried in absentia in Taiwan, he could very well avoid punishment for the murder as long as he does not set foot on the island. The Hong Kong Police Force and the Department of Justice held a meeting on Wednesday to study how to deal with the situation, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports. A spokesman for the justice department declined to comment on individual cases, but a source cited by local media revealed that authorities are considering to transfer Chan to Taiwan through a special legal arrangement in the absence of a formal extradition agreement between Hong Kong and the island. Taiwanese authorities have to file a petition to their Hong Kong counterparts, which will then propose a provisional legislation to the Legislative Council to allow the extradition, the source said. Once it is passed, Hong Kong police can then proceed to extradite Chan to Taiwan, where he would stand trial for the Poon’s murder, the source said, adding that this would be unprecedented in Hong Kong. In a statement, the Security Bureau said police are actively investigating the case as well as trying hard to handle the situation under the existing legal framework. Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, chairperson of New People’s Party and a former security chief, said Chan’s prosecution in Hong Kong for the murder he committed in Taiwan would depend on whether he had premeditated and planned the crime in Hong Kong. Barrister Albert Luk Wai-hung said it would be difficult to prove that Chan’s act was premeditated unless police found evidence that the victim had been battered, poisoned or harmed in other ways by Chan in Hong Kong. Chan appeared in a Kwun Tong Magistrates’ Court on Thursday in connection with the charges against him. The prosecution objected his bail application, although Chan did not apply for one. The magistrate approved the prosecution’s objection. Local media reported that Chan and Poon had a quarrel before her death after she revealed that she was pregnant and Chan suspected that she had another lover. Taiwanese authorities were said to have conducted an autopsy of the victim’s body. A forensic report could confirm whether the victim was pregnant.
