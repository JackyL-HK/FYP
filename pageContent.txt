
Heartbreaking article the other week about examination stress. Apparently since the Diploma of Secondary Education came into full flowering in 2012 about 71 students in the relevant age group have eluded the examiners by killing themselves. The writer, who still had fresh memories of passing the ordeal herself, thought this was shocking, and so do I. It is always difficult to be sure of the motives of people who commit suicide, and there is a tendency for one reported case to inspire imitation. Even so, I remember the days when a toll of one or two suicides in an examination season was considered bad news. We are now, it seems, running a rate of something over ten a year. A protest against student suicides. Photo: Albert Chan. The writer noted that the DSE, compared with other similar exercises, lacks continuous assessment. That is to say, your final score depends entirely on the two weeks of frantic writing at the end of the course. There is no credit for school work done earlier. She also noted that in Hong Kong the DSE was practically the only input used by universities in admissions decision-making. That, I can confirm, is certainly the case. When four-year degrees arrived, the committee of university heads decided (this was not a necessary feature of the new system) to abandon the old arrangement by which a course selected its own students. In future admission would be by faculty or school. This means that anyone working on admissions is faced with a crowd of thousands from whom they have to pick a hundred or two. No detailed consideration is possible. The exam score is effectively all there is. The only other indicator of any interest is the student’s choice. I remember several attempts to float scoring systems for extra-curricular activities, with bonus points ranging from – say – one for doing a Red Cross flag day up to ten for an Olympic medal. None of these came out as very convincing and I don’t think anyone is using one now. There is also the familiar point that a university degree means less now than it did in the days when it was a rarity. The unfortunate consequence of this is that employers who really do not need people with a university degree still use it as a way of reducing their pool of applicants to a manageable size.

This leads to the suspicion that – as one of Michael Moore’s interviewees puts it in Bowling for Columbine – if you don’t graduate you will die poor and lonely. Your future – not to mention your parents’ happiness – is at stake in the DSE and failure to meet expectations is a major personal catastrophe. I do not, I must say, remember similar angst over the corresponding examinations through which I plodded many years ago. The writing was all done in two or three weeks – continuous assessment had not been invented – and we had to do the whole thing twice (it was called O and A Levels). It may be that as a sort of supergeek for whom examinations came easily I missed symptoms of tension in my classmates. But there is not much privacy in a boarding school. Then maybe we were let off the hook by the 11 plus. This was an exam (which was supposed to be a mere “IQ test”) taken at the end of primary education. It may have caused some stress, but most of us were too young to take it that seriously, and at least the stress did not coincide with teenage turmoil. Those who took the exam were then allocated either to Grammar Schools (this outcome was familiarly described as “passed”) or to Secondary Modern Schools, which were noticeably less affluent and prestigious (“failed”). There was supposed to be a third category of Technical Schools for the NCOs of industry, but few of these actually appeared. Everyone in my school had, by definition, “passed” the 11 plus. So we may subconsciously have thought that we already had Business Class tickets for the 747 of life. Getting into university was still very unusual. For most of us it was hoped for but not expected. Perhaps, raised on the stories of our parents’ privations in World War Two, we set the bar for complaints a bit higher than it is set now. Employers, anyway, rarely insisted on a degree. Many professions which now require a degree, including the Law and journalism, still admitted most of their recruits fresh from school. The University of Hong Kong. Photo: 马克爱生活 via flickr. This absence of stress at school was more than compensated by a surplus at university. The one I attended offered an idyllic existence for three years. You then had a week of “Finals” which was rather reminiscent of that legendary Chinese examination in which candidates for the civil service were shut up in a room for a week and told to write down all they knew. We had six hours of exams on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Sunday off, six hours on Monday and a last burst on Tuesday morning, after which there was an understandable tendency for the exhausted examinee to get resoundingly drunk. An oddity I noticed on arrival was that all student rooms had brand new electric fires. This was because the university had decreed, after a spate of student suicides using gas, that all gas fires should be replaced with something less obviously lethal.  This was a success. Nobody killed him or herself while I was there. Some people continued to get special dispensation to take their Finals in the local mental hospital. In small colleges there was constant vigilance. I remember the Dean of my place, seeing me sitting on the steps of a church (I was waiting for a friend) drew disturbing conclusions about my state of mind. He stopped his car in the middle of the street, ignored the ensuing hoots of outrage from other motorists and ran across to ask if I was alright. At the University of London I heard of an odious arrangement in some of the more sought-after science programmes. They would admit about 20 per cent more students to the first year than they had places for in the laboratory subjects which started in the second. At the end of the first year the bottom 20 per cent in the pecking order were simply expelled. The results of this can be imagined. One of my first attempts at journalism was a column in a student publication at the University of Lancaster drawing attention to two recent attempts at suicide (both, fortunately, half-hearted and unsuccessful) and wondering if exam stress could be reduced as this seemed to be a cause.

I then got a polite hand-written letter from the Vice Chancellor saying that he was willing to try anything, but reducing the significance of exams appeared to be not so much a way of reducing stress as a way of spreading it over a longer period. We discussed the matter further and agreed that a student counselling service was a good idea. As I was the student union president at the time this proposal was sure of a favourable wind from several directions and materialised rather quickly. I do not know if it helped. And this gets us back to where we started. Yes, the DSE is a stressful experience which some victims do not survive. But what would help? I suppose there is no practical objection to spreading the exams over, say, four weeks instead of two. Would that reduce stress or spread it out? Using continuous assessment of school work is a big ask because it puts teachers in a complicated situation. How much help is permissible; how much benevolent marking do their pastoral obligations require? It seems also that while the student whose continuous assessment is successful can comfort himself with the thought that he enters the exam room with some money in the bank, as it were, the student who is less successful in term time may find the exam an even more onerous and frightening ordeal than if he was allowed to start from scratch. Students taking Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (DSE). Photo: HKEAA. Counselling can help, and a lot of people now offer it. I fear those who most need it are the least likely to ask. The unlikely reform which I think would help is giving more thought to the idea that the entire student population should take the same exam. The consequence of this is a large group of candidates entering the examination room knowing that their chances of passing are minimal or non-existent. A further large group in the same boat may not realise this until they see the actual questions. When I took the French Oral exam (a one-to-one chat with visiting examiner) we were admitted in alphabetical order. The first person out was besieged by an eager crowd asking what the examiner had wanted to talk about. Unfortunately this boy was not a strong candidate. “I don’t know,” he said, “she was talking in a foreign language.” Seriously, though, the business of preparing people for an arbitrary and unnecessary encounter with failure is gratuitously cruel. There may be something in the idea that those who aspire to life’s glittering prizes should be willing to suck it up and tough it out on occasion. The rest of us do not need to be prepared for a seat at the back of the bus. Life will provide us with as many examples of failure and rejection as a sane person needs. We do not need an extra dollop from the education system.

By Heidy Lo DSE. Three letters that strike fear into every Hong Kong student and cause debilitating anxiety. As someone who has experienced the DSE and who now works as a tutor for this year’s cohort, I want to reflect on this destructively stressful examination and its long-term effects. With this year’s exams starting, we need to raise awareness of the tremendous pressure Hong Kong students are under and be mindful of its dangers. Photo: Stand News. Hong Kong’s Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) – the public examination students take in the final year of secondary school – is among the most high-pressure exams in the world. The DSE has a relatively low coursework element and less flexibility – compared with the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the AS and A2 Level exams in the UK – so the fate of students comes down to the final two weeks of exams rather than the pressure being spread throughout the year. Furthermore, university entry requirements in Hong Kong are almost solely DSE-based, drawing a straight connection between the DSE and future employability that cranks up the pressure on students even further. According to the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the unemployment rate was 2.5 percent in January 2017 for people with a BA degree, while it is more than double that for those without one. For prestigious universities like HKU, the graduate employment rate has been close to 100 per cent for over a decade. With the DSE as the only gateway to these vital qualifications, the pressure is enormous. This can have disastrous consequences. Since 2013, the second year of the DSE, about 71 students have committed suicide. For students, there are immense stress levels and various forms of mental illness. During the last months of secondary school, work piles up, extra lessons and tutor classes take up all free time and expectations from various angles suffocate the students. Fear of missing out without a “superstar tutor” adds further worry. At the same time, tutors like Billy Ng expect students to deal with it all, saying things like: “Young people just have to get over the pressure. That’s life.” One student from this year’s cohort described the pressure they are under as “so overwhelming that I was unable to catch my breath.” A protest raising awareness of student suicides. Photo: Albert Chan. A former DSE student myself, I remember those final exams as the worst time of my life. I became depressed, suffered from high levels of stress and I can now see that my teenage self was unable to handle this stress, combined with all the other emotions of being a young person. Expectations from my family, friends, teachers, classmates and from myself pushed me close to the edge. I became unable to eat, I suffered from chronic insomnia and I closed myself off socially. I am not a social person by nature, but due to the pressure of the DSE I essentially became mute. Though I still interacted with people superficially, I never talked about my feelings and felt I should not do so because there was nothing unique about my experience: everyone was going through the same thing. After finishing the DSE, I thought I had recovered from the ordeal but even now in times of high pressure my body can revert to the intense fight or flight mode created by the DSE and the negative symptoms can reappear. The intense stress of the DSE period has a potentially traumatic effect that can remain with students long after the event. In the long term, changes must be made in universities’ entry requirements and in the DSE system itself to ease the pressure on students. In the meantime, we may have to settle for raising awareness of the pressures involved in this uniquely traumatic exam, and paying careful attention to those going through the process in the next two months. Heidy Lo is a survivor of the 2015 DSE. She is a local student in Hong Kong completing her undergraduate degree in English and working as a tutor of DSE students.   Comments

[This article contains images some readers may find distressing] A Hong Kong kindergarten attended by a five-year-old who reportedly died after being found unconscious at home was aware of multiple bruises suffered by the girl months before her tragic death, according to photos taken by teachers and obtained by FactWire. Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said in a press release on 10 January that it had opened an investigation to look into the case. Photo: Factwire. On 6 January, Chan Sui-lam was rushed to hospital covered in bruises but was declared dead on arrival. Her 26-year-old father and 27-year-old stepmother were arrested and subsequently charged with murder two days later. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. Vivian Yu Mei-ying, principal of Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery in Tuen Mun, told reporters at the time that the kindergarten did not find any injuries on the girl before Sui-lam quit the school in late October. Vivian Yu Mei-ying, principal of Fu Tai Lutheran Day Nursery in Tuen Mun, did not respond to any questions from reporters. Photo: Factwire. However, dozens of images obtained by FactWire have raised questions over that claim and whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy. The two sets of photos, including 19 images taken on 5 September and seven on 25 September, show a number of bruises all over her body, including on both of her arms, hands, legs and feet. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. The first set of photos includes one showing a badly swollen right palm, while photos in the second set show bruise marks across her right cheek and a scabbed wound on her left. Multiple sources have verified the photos and confirmed they were taken by teachers at the kindergarten. One whistleblower told FactWire that Yu, the principal, explicitly told teachers to photograph the bruises when they were first spotted. The source added that teachers had later submitted a report, which was signed by Yu and accompanied with photographs, documenting the details of Sui-lam’s injuries found on 5 and 25 September. Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said in a press release on 10 January that it had opened an investigation to look into the case. Photo: Factwire. Injuries found on other occasions, include red marks and peeling skin on her ear, were not included in the report, said another source. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. Sui-lam had stopped attending school on 27 October and was officially withdrawn from the kindergarten in December. Her case was also reported to the preschool’s supervisor around that time, according to a source close to the operator Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service. Photos taken by teachers show Sui-lam’s bruises. Photo: Factwire. But speaking to reporters two days after her death, Yu insisted the school had found no injuries on the girl and therefore never filed any injury report with the Education Bureau nor the Social Welfare Department. She added that teachers would have noticed the bruises because pupils were wearing short-sleeve uniforms in September. Chan Sui-lam. Photo: Factwire. Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service said in a press release on 10 January that it took allegations that the school was previously alerted of the situation very seriously and had opened an investigation to look into the matter. ‘The service has promised it would invite the relevant departments and independent parties to join in the investigation whenever appropriate,’ the statement said. The organisation has yet to release findings from its internal probe. Yu has just returned to work last Wednesday after taking a leave of absence after the incident. She did not respond to any questions about Sui-lam’s case at the kindergarten yesterday. The Reverend Daniel Li Yat-shing, the kindergarten’s supervisor and first vice-president of the Lutheran Church Hong Kong Synod, also declined to comment on whether the church knew about the injuries before the girl’s death, citing ongoing legal proceedings.

As one of his first official acts as President of the United States, Donald Trump picked up the congratulatory call from his Taiwanese colleague Tsai Ing-wen. With this call, the small state with a population of 24 million enraged the mighty People’s Republic of China. There, this diplomatic appreciation of the tiny island off its shore was read as no less than an infringement on its own sovereignty. The dispute behind these procedures is seventy years old: while the Communist Party of China considers Taiwan to be an integral part of its territory, many Taiwanese citizens beg to disagree. In the aftermath of the Chinese civil war, from which Mao’s Communists emerged victoriously, the members of the defeated Kuomintang Party regrouped in Taiwan, hoping to reclaim mainland China from the Communists in due course. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen speaks on the phone with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump at her office in Taipei, Taiwan, in this handout photo made available December 3, 2016. Photo: Taiwan Presidential Office/Handout via Reuters. First, however, they transformed the island into a one-party dictatorship, alike that of the Communists bordering on their shores. The older generations of Taiwanese still recall these days of the ‘White Terror’. While Mao thus proclaimed the People’s Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek declared the Republic of China of Taiwan. Both claimed to represent the singular, real China. After Chiang’s death in 1975, liberalisations began in Taiwan that paved the road for the first free parliamentary elections in 1992. The Kuomintang, who remained in power for the first few legislative cycles, became the advocates for a peaceful reunification with China. The ‘One China’ doctrine, to which Peking regularly appeals until today, dates back to these days. Nonetheless, both sides have not since stepped back from their claim to represent this ‘One China’. As diplomatic ties developed between Taiwan and the US, Taiwan was guaranteed its special status. However, the incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, is chairwoman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Her election in 2016 alarmed Peking, as reunification is no topic for the DPP. It is Taiwan’s young generation that brought the DPP to power. This generation neither has an interest in a reissue of a conflict between two war parties that dates back to 1949, nor does it feel any allegiance to the inheritance of mainland China. They consider themselves to be Taiwanese. The more radical of them took to the streets in the 2014 Sunflower-Movement, successfully squatting Parliament to prevent the Kuomintang from granting China more economic, and thus political, influence on the island. Today, five of these ‘radicals’ are Members of Parliament. Photo: Taiwan Presidential Office Flickr. That is a fortune denied to their counterparts in nearby Hong Kong. There, the protagonists of the student movements were sentenced to jail. The PRC shows little concern for contracts that guaranteed to respect Hong Kong’s democratic culture of the country. The People’s Republic, encouraged by its economic success to export its autocratic political model, has lately held the reins more tightly on Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Chinese intrusion in Hong Kong’s democracy has also sparked fears on Taiwan. The future of democracy will thus be decided in Taiwan. US Congress lately acknowledged this and appreciated Taiwan diplomatically. The technocratic ‘Taiwan Travel Act’ allows, up to the ministerial level, US diplomatic visits to Taipei and vice versa. China is, yet again, enraged. The Communist superpower watches with eagle’s eyes that no terms are publicly used that could signal the independence of Taiwan. In this pursuit, airlines and hotels were pressured to delete Taiwan as an independent country option on their websites. German giant Lufthansa followed suit and joined the sad ranks of Daimler, whose CEO Dieter Zetsche sucked up to Peking after a quote of the Dalai Lama had surfaced on the company’s social media channels. Tibet, too, is considered part of its territory by the PRC. German corporates, to protect their market shares, are in cahoots with the authoritarian regime, humiliating the Federal Republic of Germany and debasing European values.  It is thus invigorating to see the US Congress stand up to the behaviour of the PRC. The German Bundestag should follow suit and strengthen its bonds with Taiwan and Hong Kong, given that they, together with the democracies of South Korea and Japan, are the West’s allies in the region. These are the countries that feature freedom of opinion, press, and religion. Taiwan will introduce marriage equality coined in the Western example as the first Asian state. Meanwhile, China has sounded the attack on the Western, democratic and open system. In this struggle of the systems, China is certainly no enemy of the West as Russia was during the Cold War: the country does not aim for military expansion. Yet, it is uncompromising in its economic strategy to expand its sphere of influence across the globe through ingenious investments, and thereby become an antipole of the free world order established and guaranteed by the US after the Second War.

Hong Kong authorities want to extradite a 19-year-old local man to Taiwan to face justice after killing his girlfriend and stuffing her body in a suitcase during a trip to the island last month. The suspect, surnamed Chan, an associate degree student from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, admitted during interrogation by Hong Kong police on Tuesday that he killed his girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, 20, a student at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education, and stuffed her body in a suitcase which he later dumped near a metro station in Taipei. However, Chan was only charged with two counts of theft and one count of handling stolen goods after he confessed using Poon’s ATM card to withdraw NT$20,000 (US$683) in Taiwan on Feb. 17 and HK$8,500 (US$1,084) in Hong Kong on Feb. 20. That’s because the killing happened in Taiwan, which does not have an extradition agreement with Hong Kong. Even if Chan is tried in absentia in Taiwan, he could very well avoid punishment for the murder as long as he does not set foot on the island. The Hong Kong Police Force and the Department of Justice held a meeting on Wednesday to study how to deal with the situation, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports. A spokesman for the justice department declined to comment on individual cases, but a source cited by local media revealed that authorities are considering to transfer Chan to Taiwan through a special legal arrangement in the absence of a formal extradition agreement between Hong Kong and the island. Taiwanese authorities have to file a petition to their Hong Kong counterparts, which will then propose a provisional legislation to the Legislative Council to allow the extradition, the source said. Once it is passed, Hong Kong police can then proceed to extradite Chan to Taiwan, where he would stand trial for the Poon’s murder, the source said, adding that this would be unprecedented in Hong Kong. In a statement, the Security Bureau said police are actively investigating the case as well as trying hard to handle the situation under the existing legal framework. Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, chairperson of New People’s Party and a former security chief, said Chan’s prosecution in Hong Kong for the murder he committed in Taiwan would depend on whether he had premeditated and planned the crime in Hong Kong. Barrister Albert Luk Wai-hung said it would be difficult to prove that Chan’s act was premeditated unless police found evidence that the victim had been battered, poisoned or harmed in other ways by Chan in Hong Kong. Chan appeared in a Kwun Tong Magistrates’ Court on Thursday in connection with the charges against him. The prosecution objected his bail application, although Chan did not apply for one. The magistrate approved the prosecution’s objection. Local media reported that Chan and Poon had a quarrel before her death after she revealed that she was pregnant and Chan suspected that she had another lover. Taiwanese authorities were said to have conducted an autopsy of the victim’s body. A forensic report could confirm whether the victim was pregnant.

Hong Kong police arrested a 19-year-old man after he admitted killing his girlfriend when they traveled to Taiwan last month. The body of the victim, Poon Hiu-wing, 20, a student at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education, was found in a plastic bag that was dumped in a grassy area near the Taipei Metro Zhuwei station by Taiwan police, Apple Daily reports. Police investigation revealed that the man, surnamed Chan, an associate degree student from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and Poon went to Taiwan on Feb. 7 for a 10-day trip. The two spent a few days in Kaohsiung city in southern Taiwan before going to Taipei to celebrate Valentine’s Day on Feb. 14. Poon had told her family she would return home on Feb. 17, the second day of the Lunar New Year. When she did not come back days after that, the family called Poon’s phone number but nobody picked up the calls. On March 5, Poon’s mother approached Hong Kong police for assistance. Later, Poon’s father learned that Chan returned to Hong Kong alone on Feb. 17. He then went to ask him where she was, and was told by Chan that they had separated after a quarrel and he had never seen her since. Officers of the missing persons unit of the Kowloon East Region police district questioned Chan and found him in possession of Poon’s ATM card. Chan admitted that he used it to withdraw NT$20,000 (US$683) on Feb.17 and HK$8,500 (US$1,084) on Feb. 20. On Sunday, Poon’s father flew to Taipei to seek assistance from local police, who later confirmed Chan left the hotel alone on the morning of Feb. 17, carrying a pink suitcase, and returned to the hotel in the evening without it.  After receiving a request from their Taiwanese counterparts to follow up the case, Hong Kong police located Chan on Tuesday and questioned him at the Tseung Kwan O Police Station. It is understood that Chan admitted under interrogation that he killed his girlfriend and put her body in a luggage. It is not clear what motivated him to kill Poon. Chan went to an area near the Taipei Metro Zhuwei station in Tamsui district, where he dumped the body of the victim wrapped in plastic, police said. He left the suitcase in Zhongshan district. Police said Chan was arrested for theft in connection with Poon’s ATM card, and not for the killing, which happened in Taiwan. Hong Kong and Taiwan have no extradition agreement. On Wednesday morning Taiwanese forensics staff collected evidence at the scene. Officers were to conduct an autopsy of the body in the afternoon to confirm the cause of death. – Contact us at [email protected] TL/JC/CG 
Social welfare sector lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun has hit out at Chief Executive Carrie Lam for neglecting to mention the problem of student suicides in her policy address. During a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Council on Thursday, Shiu told Lam that there were two instances of suicide and attempted suicide earlier that day. A CUHK student was taken to the hospital around 2am after a suspected suicide attempt, and an 11-year-old boy in school uniform died after falling from a building in Tai Po, according to Ming Pao and RTHK. Carrie Lam. Photo: HKFP/Catherine Lai. “Over the past two years, there have been over 72 suicides among young people, from primary school students to postgraduate students. 72 is not a number; it concerns stories, and lives,” Shiu said. “In the policy address, the focus is not on housing, but on developing the economy, benefitting those with invested interests, innovation with One Belt One Road, massive infrastructure projects… it’s all about money.” “What is the price of a young person’s life? What is the price of 72 lives?… Under what circumstances will you properly and solemnly respond to the problem of youth suicides, and host a summit on youth suicides? It’s only by respecting death that you can respect life,” Shiu said. In response, Lam said that there was “no need to use such emotional language,” and added that she started being concerned about youth suicides when she was the Director of Social Welfare. “If you ask Professor Paul Yip, who has done the most research on suicides in Hong Kong, I have long demonstrated concern over the issue and in order to facilitate his research, I have requested that departments make numbers available to him.” Shiu Ka-chun holding a list of dates on which students committed suicide. Photo: HKFP/Catherine Lai. She also said that she does not recall any requests for a summit, but promised to ask the Secretary for Labour and Welfare to follow up. Earlier this year, concern groups petitioned Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, urging him to hold a summit on youth suicides. Lam stressed that “the government cares a lot about mental health issues, especially those relating to young people.” Her policy address did not mention student suicides specifically, but it said: “Based on the evaluation results of the Student Mental Health Support Pilot Scheme, we will consider ways to provide appropriate support services for students with mental health needs.” If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255.

More than 100 people took part in a barefoot march on Sunday in Hong Kong, calling on the government to pay more attention to the issue of student suicides.  The rally, led by members from two concern groups — the Civil Alliance for Student Suicide Prevention, and Parents United of Hong Kong — saw the participants walk from the Legislative Council to the Chief Executive’s Office without any footwear. During the event, protesters demanded that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor take the youth suicide problem seriously and carry out changes in the education system, Apple Daily reports. The march came amid mounting concerns among parents, teachers and social workers after Hong Kong witnessed 74 student suicides in the city between August 2015 and October 12 this year. During the rally Sunday, protestors took off their shoes and placed them on a black banner on the floor, with all 74 suicide dates marked out on the banner in order to remind the public of the tragic incidents. Each pair of shoes represents one forgotten child, the Civil Alliance said. By visualizing the suicide cases in such a way, the group said it hoped to raise awareness in society about the problem. After the demonstration was over, the protestors all bowed down in silence as the dates of the students’ suicides were recited. However, neither Carrie Lam nor any staff from the Office of the Chief Executive met with the groups to receive their letter. Both the organizations backed Legislator Shiu Ka-chun’s idea that the government should launch a summit to handle student suicide problems, news website HK01.com reports. The idea was rejected by Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Law Chi-kwong, with the official arguing that a high-profile summit would only “spread the infectious idea of suicide”. The concern groups responded by stating that the summit would not tackle each suicide case individually, but will only discuss ways to improve the entire system as a whole. The organizations will meet with the Education Secretary Kevin Yeung Yun-hung soon to discuss the topic. They have also arranged to meet the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, and Secretary for Home Affairs. A teacher surnamed Yam said he joined Sunday’s protest because he believes the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education examination is causing too much stress for students. Yam told Apple Daily that each time a student commits suicide, he feels as if he himself had been the executioner as he had been teaching them and giving them homework. A parent at the protest, a woman surnamed Wong, said that her daughter had been forced to start writing at the young age of two. She pointed out that the child has come under great stress and had felt unhappy because she could not write the characters properly. As the Hong Kong education system puts too much stress on results, many schools had pushed their students too hard and made matters worse. A spokesperson from the Civil Alliance, Cheung Sau-yin, called on the government to establish an inter-departmental committee to solve the problems of mandatory social workers at schools. If that is done, many problems can be looked into with more effective communication, Cheung said. Tong Chung-yee, a spokesperson for Parents United, noted that authorities had started a program where schools were given HK$200,000 funding for promoting mental health, under the “Joyful at School” initiative. However, she cited official statistics as showing that only 40 percent of the schools had been given the green light for the program. Given this situation, Tong urged the government to allow more schools to benefit from the scheme. - Contact us at [email protected] EL/BN/RC 
The government is under pressure to take measures after three student suicide cases were reported in one day on Thursday. One of the victims, an 18-year-old secondary 6 student, was saved by passers-by after he jumped into the river from a pedestrian overpass near the Tai Po Mega Mall, Apple Daily reports. He was in his school uniform.  A source said pressure from schoolwork drove him to try to kill himself. At around 7 a.m., an 11-year-old primary six pupil was found lying on the ground at Kwong Yau House in Kwong Fuk Estate, a public rental housing estate in Tai Po where he and his family lived. He was rushed to hospital where he was later pronounced dead. Investigators said the boy jumped off the building because he could not deal with the death of his grandmother and the impending divorce of his parents. A secondary six student also died in hospital after he jumped off the top of the Domain Mall in Yau Tong at about 11:21 a.m. Police recovered a note at the scene, in which the 17-year-old said he was under pressure and felt he had no direction in life. Social welfare functional constituency lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun and the Civil Alliance for Student Suicide Prevention urged the government to take action to prevent a recurrence of the incidents. They proposed a government-led anti-teenage suicide summit to help tackle the problem.  More than 20 students have committed suicide so far this year, according to Apple Daily.

No let up in student suicide battle Schools are better prepared to prevent student suicides this year, but more needs to be done through social media, an expert says. "Apart from talking about classes, the schools also tell students to seek help if they have problems," said Paul Yip Siu- fai, the head of the Education Bureau's Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides. "We have more preparations than before, but we will not relax," Yip said yesterday. Yip, director of the University of Hong Kong's Center for Suicide Research and Prevention, was appointed last year to head the panel following a spate of student suicides. The committee's final report and recommendations were submitted to the then-secretary for education Eddie Ng Hak-kim in November. Yip said the committee is discussing with social-media giants, including Facebook and Google, about procedures for handling signs of potential suicides on the internet and how to find those students as quickly as possible. He said students express such signs in many ways. "It is not necessary that they will release these signals through phone calls - they can be on WhatsApp, in emojis or by leaving comments on Facebook," he said.  Yip said the authorities also helped teachers to improve their ability to detect students who have problems, and to put more resources in the education sector. He also appreciated the positive changes in media reports, saying there were fewer sensational reports about students committing suicide in the past six months. The Social Welfare Department's Child Fatality Review Panel released its third report on Thursday, saying there were 20 child or youth suicide cases among 206 deaths of children aged below 18 in 2012 and 2013 reported to the Coroner's Court, including those who died of natural and non- natural causes. It also said children and youngsters committing suicide were mainly due to "schoolwork problems, worries about their futures and relationship problems with family members or boyfriends or girlfriends." Yip quoted the report as saying about 70 percent of children who committed suicide showed suicidal signs but adults sometimes ignored those signals because they were too busy.  The associate director of the HKU center, Liu Kwong-sun, said parents have to spend more time with their children and communicate with them directly, including using the internet. Liu also said students face much greater pressure than previous generations. Parents and teachers should also help children to improve their emotional management skills and not just focus on academic results. Today's Standard

 Suicides in Hong Kong Tools include flagging worrying posts and featuring help tips more prominently Comments:    A government-appointed student suicide prevention committee has been in talks with Google and Facebook on how to identify and help young people in Hong Kong who have suicidal tendencies. Citing an official report released last week on child fatality, Professor Paul Yip Siu-fai, who chairs the committee, said on Sunday that about 70 per cent of young Hongkongers who committed suicide had shown warning signs in different ways. “We have been discussing with Google and Facebook how to respond actively when some people show warning signs online and how to identify this group of people as soon as possible,” Yip said. “These signs may not just be a phone call, but also WhatsApp messages, emojis and Facebook posts.”  Facebook has introduced a suicide prevention tool enabling users to flag posts from friends who show warning signs. The company then sends a list of options to the people whose activity has raised concern, including reaching out to a friend, contacting a helpline or viewing tips. Yip said the committee wanted to work with the company to establish a pattern of suicidal Facebook posts and set up an “early warning system” based on the data.  He explained such a system could automatically detect suicidal cases and allow reviewers to send reminders to the individuals concerned, their friends or schools, based on their posts. Yip noted worries about potential privacy issues in the plan, but he said most people who were suicidal would “not find it intrusive” because they were looking for help when posting alarming messages.  Google has been featuring search results about suicide prevention help and tips more prominently when users look for particular combinations such as “ways to commit suicide”. Yip said the committee had been discussing with the company ways to improve the resources for Hong Kong users. The committee was set up last year after a worrying spike in the number of youth suicides in the city. While 71 pupils took their own lives between 2013 and 2016, 23 cases were reported in the 2015-16 school year – seven in a span of 10 days. As hundreds of thousands of pupils started going back to school last Friday, the issue was again brought to public attention. Dr Liu Kwong-sun, deputy director of the Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, said many clinical cases showed suicidal intentions existed among pupils in local, direct-subsidy and international schools, students at universities and even adults who had just left the education system and started work. “This shows that the society-wide expectation of students is very high, much higher than what students can afford,” Liu said on a radio show on Sunday. “We did not have this environmental pressure in the last generation. “Could there be more room for [suicide] prevention?” Liu expressed hope the Education Bureau and schools could focus less on academic performance and more on young people’s emotional education, to encourage perseverance, responsibility and confidence.

On 13 & 14 April in the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Concert Hall, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HK Phil), conductor Zhang Guoyong and violinist Baiba Skride will perform a programme of music composed at critical times in the lives of two Russian composers. The concert opens with the famous Polonaise from Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin. This was written around the time of Tchaikovsky's disastrous marriage - which lasted three months and ended with suicidal intentions. Pushkin's original story of Eugene Onegin struck Tchaikovsky as being so much like his own personal life that he decided to set it as an opera as a means of surviving his marriage and its aftermath. Its first performance was given in 1879 by a group of Tchaikovsky's own students at the Moscow Conservatory, but despite such inauspicious beginnings, Eugene Onegin became the most successful of Tchaikovsky's 10 operas, its celebrated Polonaise one of its most spectacular and glittering moments. Latvian violinist Baiba Skride, who has been compared with the legendary violinists of the past, will perform another famous work by Tchaikovsky dating from the same turbulent and emotionally-charged period of his life: the Violin Concerto. Originally written for one of the witnesses at the composer's ill-fated wedding, the Violin Concerto is full of passion and dazzling virtuoso display. Over half a century later, Tchaikovsky's compatriot, Shostakovich, was going through his own personal crisis. Stalin had stormed out of a performance of his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District which had then been officially condemned as "muddle instead of music". Shostakovich was under threat of banishment, possibly even death, if his next work did not satisfy the Soviet authorities. That work was his Fifth Symphony and, luckily for the composer, was so well received at its premiere in 1937 that he was fully rehabilitated as an approved Soviet composer.  Recognised as an expert interpreter of Russian works, especially the music of Shostakovich, Chinese conductor Zhang Guoyong will be on the podium to bring us the excitement and heady optimism of Shostakovich's most popular symphony. Tickets priced: HK$480, $380, $280, $180 are now available at URBTIX. For enquiries, please call +852 2721 2332 or visit www.hkphil.org.  Zhang Guoyong, conductor [full biography]
Zhang Guoyong studied conducting at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music under the direction of Prof Huang Xiaotong. He is now the Professor and Dean of the conducting department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Principal Conductor of the Shanghai Opera House, and Music Director of the Qingdao Symphony Orchestra. Zhang is expert in Russian works, especially Shostakovich's symphonies. Wherever he has performed, he has always impressed the audience and musicians with his sharp hearing, strong basic skills, efficient rehearsal method and appropriate handling of the music's structure. Baiba Skride, violin [full biography]
Baiba Skride's natural approach to music-making has endeared her to some of today's most important orchestras and conductors. Prestigious orchestras with whom she has worked include the Berlin Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, Royal Concertgebouw, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, London Philharmonic and NHK Symphony. Contemporary music is central to Baiba Skride's music making. She is also a sought-after chamber musician.  The Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HK Phil) is recognised as Asia's foremost classical orchestra. Presenting more than 150 concerts over a 44-week season, the HK Phil attracts more than 200,000 music lovers annually. Jaap van Zweden, one of today's most sought-after conductors, has been the orchestra's Music Director since the 2012/13 concert season, a position he will continue to hold until 2022. Maestro van Zweden will be the next Music Director of the New York Philharmonic from the 2018/19 season. Yu Long was appointed Principal Guest Conductor with the HK Phil for a three-year period commencing with the 2015/16 season. Under the dynamic leadership of Music Director Jaap van Zweden, the HK Phil has attained new heights of artistic excellence, garnering international critical acclaim. Following on from the success of the European tour which included a filmed concert from Vienna's Musikverein, the HK Phil has toured extensively within the mainland China. In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR, and with support of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices, the orchestra recently performed in Seoul, Osaka, Singapore, Melbourne and at the Sydney Opera House. Jaap, the HK Phil, and a superb casts of soloists, have presented concert performances and recordings of the four operas from Richard Wagner's epic Ring cycle. These have been enthusiastically endorsed by both audiences and critics at home and abroad, and in recognition of their quality, the orchestra and Jaap have been invited to perform Wagner's Die Walküre in staged performances at the Beijing Music Festival last October in a co-production with the Salzburg Easter Festival. Conductors and soloists who have recently performed with the orchestra include Vladimir Ashkenazy, Charles Dutoit, Christoph Eschenbach, Matthias Goerne, Stephen Hough, Lang Lang, Yo-Yo Ma, Ning Feng and Yuja Wang. The HK Phil promotes the work of Hong Kong and Chinese composers through an active commissioning programme, and has released recordings on the Naxos label featuring Tan Dun and Bright Sheng, each conducting their own compositions. Its acclaimed education and community engagement programmes in schools, hospitals and outdoor space, bring music into the hearts of tens of thousands of children and families every year. The Swire Group has been the Principal Patron of the HK Phil since 2006. Through this sponsorship, which is the largest in the orchestra's history, Swire endeavours to promote artistic excellence, foster access to classical music and stimulate cultural participation in Hong Kong, and to enhance Hong Kong's reputation as one of the great cities of the world. Thanks to a significant subsidy from the Hong Kong Government and long-term funding from Principal Patron Swire, the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust and other supporters, the HK Phil now boasts a full-time annual schedule of core classical repertoire and innovative popular programming, extensive education and community programmes, and collaborations with, among others, Opera Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Arts Festival. Originally called the Sino-British Orchestra, it was renamed the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra in 1957 and became fully professional in 1974. The HK Phil is a charitable organisation. The Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra is financially supported by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and is Venue Partner of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. SWIRE is the Principal Patron of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra.

22-year-old student falls to death  A university student who fell from a height in Kowloon Tong today has died. 
At about 7:43am this morning, the 22-year-old man was found lying unconscious after falling from the Academic and Administration Building at Baptist University Road. 
He was rushed to hospital and later certified dead.

Hong Kong people always read in the media of battles in local courts between members of a family fighting over the inheritance of a wealthy person who has died. The bitter intra-family fights prompt citizens to exclaim how greed has destroyed love and loyalty. But last week the opposite happened – the family members of one of China’s largest philanthropists agreed not to contest his will, allowing all the money – about HK$10 billion – to go to charity. It was a rare happy ending. “This reflected the goodness in humanity,” said High Court judge David Lok Kai-hong. “Unlike other cases, probate cases often unveil the ugliness of humanity. I often see relatives and families squabble over wealth. Siblings no longer talk to each other. Although I cannot really describe a person’s death as something joyous, I am happy to deal with a case like this.” Yu Pengnian died of heart failure on May 2, 2015 in the Beijing University Hospital in Shenzhen, aged 93. On July 21, 2011, he made a will in which he said he wished to donate all his wealth to the Yu Pengnian Charitable Foundation, with his grandson Pang Chi-ping as the sole trustee. Yu had two sons and seven grandchildren; his elder son and wife had died before him. Yu’s second son and a male offspring of that son did not agree with the will and filed objections at the Probate Registry of the High Court in September and November 2015. But the family differences were finally resolved and Judge Lok validated the will, citing a doctor’s report that, at the time he made it, Yu was in good health and spirits and fully understood the contents. The judge ordered HK$1.85 million to be deducted from Yu’s assets for legal expenses. The money from his will would go through his foundation to education. “Some of the money is for poor students, some is for talented students whom I want to encourage, including foreign students who want to study in China,” Yu said before his death. “Education is very important for a country, very closely related to its prosperity and standard of living.” Asked whether his descendants objected, he said: “If my children are competent, they do not need my money. If they are not, leaving them a lot is only doing them harm.” Such an attitude is rare among wealthy entrepreneurs, especially Chinese ones. Yu’s desire to donate may be the result of his own hardship. He was born in 1922 in a village in Hunan province; his family owned a small business. As a young man, he went to Shanghai to make his fortune. He sold trinkets and pulled rickshaws on the streets until 1954 when he was arrested, on the false accusation that he came from a family of wealthy landlords. He served three years in a center “for thought correction”. On his release in 1958, he fled to Hong Kong. He arrived speaking neither Cantonese nor English. He started work as a cleaner in a large firm, learnt Cantonese and worked his way into a junior management position. He saved everything he earned and often slept on the floor of his office. In the 1960s, he and friends pooled their money and bought their first property. This was his road to wealth. He bought many buildings in Kowloon Tong; some were rented as ‘love hotels’, for renting by the hour by amorous couples who wanted to avoid parental control. In 1975, Yu paid HK$850,000 for the former home of Bruce Lee. He wanted to give it to the Hong Kong government, for use as a museum. In 2000, he developed cataracts and had a successful operation to repair his eyes. He found that 400,000 Chinese developed cataracts every year; many could not afford the surgery they needed. He decided to spend $10 million a year on mobile clinics to perform surgeries to remove cataracts in remote parts of China. Since 2003, these clinics have carried out more than 150,000 cataract operations around the country. One principle of his philanthropy was to give directly to the recipients. He followed that path after discovering that many of his early donations had been stolen by corrupt officials. “In China, I do charity only with my own eyes and hands. I do not trust others,” he said. Yu spent his final years on the top floor of the Penglin Hotel he owned in Shenzhen. He ate most of his meals in its buffet restaurant. The Hurun Report rated him the top philanthropist in China for five years running. In the “China Dream” of the future, Mr Yu is an example to follow. – Contact us at [email protected] RC 
A jury at the Coroner’s Court unanimously decided that a student from Chinese YMCA Secondary School in Tin Shui Wai committed suicide last year, hk01.com reports. After the decision on Tuesday, Coroner Ko Wai-hung told family members of the 17-year-old student not to blame themselves but to find strength to continue living as the accident no doubt has had a great impact on them. The student was found lying on the ground in front of a building on the school campus on Aug. 5 last year. With multiple body injuries, he was rushed to Pok Oi Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. Investigation led police to believe that he jumped to his death from the sixth floor of the building after he returned to school to turn in his summer homework. The student’s mother told the court on Tuesday that her son had never shown any inclination to harm himself. Footage from security cameras on the campus showed Lee walking by himself to the sixth floor before he climbed over the fence and jumped.

There has been a rise in student suicides in the city in recent years. More than 60 youngsters took their lives between September 2015 and April this year, or an average of three students each month. When there are so many such tragedies, society appears to have become accustomed to the situation, as if it’s the new “normal” in today’s Hong Kong. And a vicious circle seems to be happening; more suicides “goad” more disgruntled students to take the same path. Parents, and society as a whole, need to do some soul-searching as to what factors are pushing our students off the edge – heavy loads of schoolwork, anxiety over academic records, disputes with family members, relationship problems with boyfriend/girlfriend, etc. A student who grows up in a happy family is unlikely to commit suicide. Parents and other family members are the first and last ones that a student with suicidal issues can count on. One’s bond with parents may slacken during adolescence when the emotionally tumultuous period is often aggravated by inadequate communication with parents and disagreements over choice and outlook. Instead of trying to rein them in and forcing them to accept a set of values, parents should be more accommodative to their kids, who are in a precarious stage of transition toward adulthood. Treating adolescents with respect and showing them that we are willing to listen to them can go a long way in helping them sail through a bewildering period in their lives. The home can be a safe haven and a launch pad for youngsters as they explore and decide on the path of life they should take, and especially when crunch time comes. But if parents always resort to censure and suppression whenever their kids revolt against their expectations or simply become less tractable, they risk alienating the young adults, who may choose some radical ways to escape from bridled circumstances rather than seeking help from the family. This may add up to their feeling of estrangement, which may lead them to consider suicide as an option. A lesson from many rueful parents is that some students may try to keep their stress under wraps even when they have long been feeling despondent or even thinking of ending their lives. Parents need to spend time with their children to listen to their views and anxieties. Psychologists tell us that taking one’s own life is a result of long planning and emotional struggles, which always involve a host of factors. Spur-of-the-moment suicides are exceptionally rare, as they are against human nature and instinct for survival. It may take up to 90 days, with multiple phases, from thinking of suicide to actually committing it. These phases can be summarized by five Ds: difficulty leads to disorder, then to desperation, and in turn a decision to end one’s life, including when and how.  The final stage is “discharge”, in which he or she may dispose of items they used to love or value a lot. Parents must ask themselves: Does suicide really occur without any indication, or is it just that parents fail, or are too busy, to take note of them?

Education University (EdUHK) and the Education Bureau have condemned messages that “congratulated” a government official’s son after his death. The eldest son of Education Undersecretary Choi Yuk-lin died after falling from a Tsim Sha Tsui flat on Thursday morning. The reasons for the incident are still unknown. Signs bearing the slogan “Congratulations Choi Yuk-lin’s son on going west” subsequently appeared on the campus’s Democracy Wall, on top of banners supporting freedom of expression and Hong Kong independence. Signs saying “Congratulations Choi Yuk-lin’s son on going west” appeared on top of other signs protesting the removal of banners advocating independence on Education University’s Democracy Wall. Photo: Chung Kim Wah/Facebook. EdUHK issued a statement condemning the signs and apologising for any hurt they may have caused. “The school would like to reaffirm that, whilst we enjoy our rights to freedom of expression, we should also use a peaceful and reasonable attitude to discuss different events, and respect others’ feelings. In this case, the offensive acts are shameful – we hope that the posters of the signs will be able to self-reflect,” it said. The university said that it is reviewing CCTV footage and will take action where necessary. Messages attacking the family were also posted online: “You knew that your son was depressed. Instead of spending time with him, you accepted a promotion and became even busier, leaving your son to be taken care of by a domestic worker. What an educational role model! You don’t even know how to be someone’s mother, how can you educate other people’s children? You are such a failure, you should resign,” one commenter said on discussion forum LIHKG. Another user attacked the Education Bureau for not “breaking a sweat” sooner over previous teacher and pupil deaths. Localist lawmaker Cheng Chung-tai aired similar sentiments on Facebook: “Now that something has happened so close to you, Education Bureau official, do you finally feel the cruelty of the education system? Don’t say that the people piling on are being insensitive – because these are the seeds that you have sowed.” ‘Inhumane monsters’ The Education Bureau (EDB) said that it “severely condemned the vicious and maliciously offensive behaviour” of the people responsible for the signs at the university, and thanked school authorities for taking immediate action. Choi Yuk-lin. File Photo: Apple Daily. On Thursday, pro-Beijing lawmaker Ben Chan launched a petition urging EdUHK to find the person responsible for the signs. “Demand that Education University use CCTV to uncover the inhumane monsters, and expel them from the school, to prevent this animal from becoming a teacher and misguiding their children!” he said. The university’s student union issued a statement saying that it was not responsible for the signs, and that it had sent representatives to take them down. It said the university should not use the event as an opportunity to curtail students’ right to freedom of expression. “We have still not been able to confirm if the involved party is a student of the university. In any case, it is clear that if a student is punished by school authorities as a result of a morally controversial statement, it will lead students in the future to be scared of expressing their views, self-censoring, and creating white terror on campus,” said the statement. The union said that the university should respect the autonomy of the student union in managing the Democracy Wall. “Whilst we disagree with Ms. Choi on her educational policy, we will not kick someone when they’re already down due to a difference in opinion. We hope that the deceased is able to rest in peace,” it said. Choi was appointed education undersecretary in July despite controversy over her pro-Beijing political stance.

A 25-year-old man jumped to his death on Thursday morning from a luxury high-rise building near the Kowloon MTR station. Police identified the man as Poon Hong-yan, a son of Undersecretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports. They found nothing suspicious and said it was a suicide. After receiving a report at about 11:50 a.m., police arrived at Sorrento, a private housing estate in Austin Road West, and found a man lying unconscious on a ninth-floor podium. He was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Choi arrived in the hospital at around 3 p.m. Choi released a statement through the Education Bureau expressing her gratitude for the concern shown to her family and asking the public to give them space while they grieve. Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung expressed his condolences to Choi and her family. Investigators said the man was the older of Choi’s two sons. He jumped from the family’s apartment on the 41st floor of tower three of the estate. Poon was a physiotherapist at North District Hospital in Sheung Shui. He graduated from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Police said he was earlier stopped by the family’s domestic helper from his suicide attempt before he locked himself up in his bedroom and jumped out the window about an hour later. He did not leave a note. Poon had been keen about sports like marathon and cycling. Choi once enrolled in a 10-kilometer run for charity that Poon also participated in. Poon, however, was forced to stop running after suffering from brain injuries in an accident during a triathlon last year. His social media posts showed he was recovering well. In fact, he was stricken with depression after the accident, according to one of Choi’s friends. Poon’s death was unrelated to Choi’s government job and her controversial pro-Beijing stance, the friend said. Choi was appointed on Aug. 1 by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, sparking accusations that Lam was trying to push national education in the school curriculum. Choi is a former vice chair of the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, which published teaching materials on national education that led to mass protests in 2012. Not long after news about her son’s death broke out, an offensive post was seen on the “democracy wall” of the Education University of Hong Kong. The school condemned the post and vowed to find who was responsible. - Contact us at [email protected] EJ Insight supports efforts to help people deal with depression and related issues.

Suicide survey shows new alert for school pupils An alarming 30 percent of senior primary school students and 40 percent of junior secondary school students are at risk of suicide, says a new survey. The Hong Kong Jockey Club and City University of Hong Kong interviewed 464 Secondary One students from four schools and 449 Primary Five and Six students from two schools last September and October. The survey found that 31.6 percent of primary pupils and 40.3 percent of secondary schoolchildren are considered vulnerable - scoring 11 or above out of 30 in the suicidal risk assessment.  Nearly half of the vulnerable cases indicated that they have a suicidal wish.  Applied social sciences associate professor Kwok Lai Yuk-ching noted that Secondary One students face an especially high suicide risk. "As secondary One students need to adapt to many changes, including a new learning environment, social circle and physical changes during puberty, they are more likely to be emotionally stressed and develop a suicidal wish," Kwok said. "We need to pay more attention to their emotions." Kwok advised parents to find solutions with their children and also let them make decisions so the kids know they are able to handle and control the environment. The survey also showed that if students feel hopeless and perceive themselves as a burden to others, they are at higher risk of suicide. If they feel happy and recognize their self-worth, the risk is lower. Chow Mung-sze, a mother of a Secondary Two boy and a Primary Two girl, said her children experienced emotional problems frequently.  "My daughter always gets upset and cries a lot. She even told me she wanted to commit suicide when she was in Primary One because she could not adapt to the huge pressure from dictation and examinations," said Chow, who joined the workshop of a project run by the Jockey Club-funded Suicide Prevention Services in the spring. "I used to ask my daughter: 'Why are you crying again in the early morning?' to stop her from crying immediately," Chow said. "But after the workshop, I realized that I should recognize her negative emotion and try to set goals and find a solution together. Now I have better communication with my children and I am happy to see my daughter smile again." Suicide Prevention Services executive director Vincent Ng Chi-kwan warned that now is a high-risk period for students' emotional and suicidal problems as the final exams are approaching and the public examination result will be released soon. "Instead of saying it is not a big deal and we have all experienced the exams, we should put ourselves into their shoes and show we understand their problems, and we will stand by them through the obstacles."

A 14-year-old boy ended his life on Tuesday morning. He was the fifth to die in six attempted suicides by Hong Kong students within 17 days. The boy wore a school uniform when he died at Wah Fu Estate in Aberdeen around 7am. Wa Fu Estate. Photo: Wikicommons. His suicide may be linked to a scolding by his parents for spending too much time on computer games the night before, local media reported. The school said in a statement that its teachers and students were devastated by the news. It has set up a crisis management group and urged parents to notify the school if their children appear to be in distress. Another suicide A separate student suicide took place last Friday. A 15-year-old boy who attended an international school took his own life at Times Square in Causeway Bay at around 10pm. He told his family that he was unhappy at school prior to his action last Sunday, according to local media. The student was an enthusiast in rooftopping, a practice of taking photographs at the top of skyscrapers. He left a note on Instagram thanking his friends and social media followers before Sunday. His family has since switched the account from public to private. See also: HKFP’s comprehensive guide to mental health services in Hong Kong Time Square. Photo: Google Street View. Last Monday, a 15-year-old student ended his life in Ma On Shan, possibly related to worries over academic grades. Two student deaths from suicide were reported immediately after the end of the Lunar New Year holidays. A 16-year-old died on February 5 in Ma On Shan, while a 13-year-old died on February 6 in Tsing Yi. A 12-year-old student attempted suicide earlier this month, also reportedly due to academic pressure. She was prevented from doing so by firefighters and police officers. Last year, 35 cases of student suicide were reported.

Call to limit student study hours Concern groups proposed the setting of "standard studying hours" to reduce student stress and help to prevent suicides. Youngsters face enormous pressure under the current education system as apart from attending school, many also go to tutorial classes.  Extended study time leads to insufficient sleep and play, said the groups  Social Workers Align With Students Under Pressure and Citizens' Alliance for Prevention of Youth Suicide. On World Suicide Prevention Day yesterday, the groups urged the government to face up to the problem of students taking their own lives and consider setting regulations or guidelines to restrict the number of study hours - similar to standard working hours for employees. Over the past two months, the groups interviewed 631 students, parents, teachers and social workers, and some 90 percent supported the idea of standard studying hours. More than 70 percent believed a maximum of seven hours of study a day would be appropriate, including time spent at school and tutorial classes. Lai Pak-yin, spokesman for Social Workers Align With Students Under Pressure, said many secondary school students spend around 10 hours on their studies every day, with some even taking longer than that. He also said government suggestions for tackling student suicides are not practical for frontline teachers and social workers - it is more important to stay with students when they are going through a hard time than training them to have a positive attitude. Chan Chi-chung from Citizens' Alliance for Prevention of Youth Suicide said there should be fundamental changes in the education system, as academic studies are the main source of pressure for students. Chan also said the government should do more to create family-friendly employment practices, as many parents are too busy at work and cannot help their children in time when they have problems. Annie Cheung Yim-shuen from Parents United of Hong Kong said many parents lacked knowledge on childhood mental health. "Sometimes young people cry, go quiet, or slam the door shut, but parents often neither realize these are signs of problems nor know how to handle the situations," she said, adding the government should strengthen education for parents and provide more support to schools. Cheung said studying seven hours a day is already a long time, and many students do not get eight hours of sleep. The groups are continuing the survey until next month to gather views on ways to reduce students' pressure. They also urged the government to hold a student suicide prevention summit to listen to opinions from society. Today's Standard

A 17-year-old Secondary Six student plunged to his death from a school building in Tin Shui Wai. The incident took place at YLPMSAA Tang Siu Tong Secondary School at about 8 a.m. on Monday, Apple Daily reports. Police said the boy left a note, based on which they suspected he was stressed out over family and academic issues. The victim was found on the ground in front of the school building by students gathering for a morning assembly. He was rushed to hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The case has been listed as suicide, pending further investigation. It was understood that the boy had to attend after-school classes four days a week to prepare for the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) examination scheduled for April next year. He had reportedly sought help from the school’s social worker. The school said it formed a crisis management team soon after the incident. About 20 students are in need of emotional counseling, it said. Ng Po-shing, director of the student guidance center of Hok Yau Club, said Secondary Six students are normally under great pressure because of the coming DSE exam, hk01.com reported. He said students should try to turn pressure to motivation by clarifying the goal of study and finding ways to ease it, such as by sharing their feelings with friends, doing certain activities and seeking professional help. Tsang Chin-kwok, director of the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong, a suicide prevention organization, urged parents to pay more attention to their children’s emotional changes, especially if they appear too quiet, spiritless or confused.

Two Hong Kong secondary school students have committed suicide in the space of 24 hours after the Chinese New Year holidays. On Sunday at around 9am, a 16-year-old male secondary school student took his own life at Lee On Estate, a public housing estate in Ma On Shan. Lee On Estate. Photo: WiNG via Wikicommons. The following day at around 6am, a 13-year-old female secondary school student took her own life at Cheung Ching Estate, a public housing estate in Tsing Yi. The Education Bureau said that it was very saddened by the incidents, Apple Daily reported. It said that the relevant schools have activated their crisis response groups, and that the bureau has sent staff to the schools to provide support. The bureau also referred to the final report of the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides, published last November, which said that suicides were caused by multiple complicated interacting factors. The bureau added that it was following up with and implementing many recommendations made in the report, such as reviewing the education system to better emphasise non-academic achievements. The committee had been established by the Education Bureau in March 2016 following a spate of student suicides. The Education Bureau. File Photo: Apple Daily. On Monday, lawmaker Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu published an email he received from a form three secondary school student, criticising the Education Bureau chief Eddie Ng Hak-kim for claiming last October that student suicides could be prevented by better life planning. The student said that he was stressed over academic results because of the education system: “Like most of Hong Kong’s students, I can’t see any future. I’m studying repeatedly every single day, but I don’t understand the point of it.” 35 cases of student suicide were reported last year.

Two student suicides lead to alert for schools and parents Two secondary students have taken their own lives in the past two days, prompting another call for the government to review the education system.  Experts also urged parents to be caring and attentive to their teenagers instead of being critical. At 6.50am yesterday, a 13-year-old girl was found unconscious outside Hong Cheung House at Cheung Hong  Estate, Tsing Yi, after a fall. The girl, who was in her school uniform, was rushed to Yan Chai Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.  A suicide note was found and it is believed the girl was troubled by academic issues. Yesterday was the first day of school after the Lunar New Year break.  The grieving family went to the scene in the afternoon to mourn their loss, with the mother heard crying: "Mommy won't shout at you again. Mommy is here to bring you home."  A 16-year-old youth plunged from Lee Hing House at Lee On Estate, Ma On Shan, at about 10am on Sunday.  He was confirmed dead at Prince of Wales Hospital. No note was found.  Suicide Prevention Services executive director Vincent Ng Chi-kwan said his group's hotlines receive more than 3,000 calls a month on average, with about 500 from people aged 24 or below. Most of the young users who were emotionally troubled or even suicidal reflected pressure from school work and family issues.  Ng told parents to look for signs, including if their children have lost weight, lost interest in activities they used to be passionate about and if they are giving away items they treasure a lot or stopped caring about their appearance.  Some may even voice suicidal thoughts, Ng said.  But first, he said: "Parents should be attentive to their children. If you don't know them well, you won't be able to pick up those clues." He suggested parents to be caring to make their children feel supported, but warned them not to adopt a critical attitude. Last year, Hong Kong saw a spate of student suicides, prompting the government to appoint the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides.  But education-sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen said he did not see much change following the committee's work. Ip again expressed disappointment with the committee report, which concluded that "there is no direct correlation between student suicide cases and the overall education system."  He called upon the government to review the education system by canceling unnecessary assessments that burden pupils and looking into the student-teacher ratio.  Today's Standard

Calls for a review of the education system are growing after the back-to-back suicides of two young students soon after the Lunar New Year holidays. The victims were a 13-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy who apparently fell to their deaths, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports. The girl was found unconscious on the ground outside the Cheung Hong Estate in Tsing Yi where she lived with her family. She was last seen alive leaving home for school at around 6 a.m. A note and a new pair of black shoes were found next to her body. Police said the girl could have been feeling depressed before she decided to end her life. The actual cause of death is being investigated. Her death came just one day after a young student plunged to his death in Lee On Estate in Ma On Shan. Lawmakers are calling on education authorities to strengthen their efforts to prevent a similar tragedy. The Education Bureau cited findings by an investigation committee that student suicides are often caused by “multiple complex reasons” that influnce one another, Apple Daily reported. It promised to implement the committee’s recommendations, including a review of the entire education system and putting more weight on students’ non-academic achievements. Ng Wai-han, a senior social worker at YWCA, said many young people face pressures from schoolwork and interpersonal relationships, and they are especially vulnerable to post-holiday depression. She urged them not to put themselves in a dead end but open their minds to talk out problems. Parents should pay more attention to their children, she said. Meanwhile, Civic Party lawmaker Alvin Yeung posted to Facebook a letter sent to him by a Secondary Three student who complained that many of his peers can’t see the future since all they do every day is learn without really understanding. Yeung urged Secretary for Education Eddie Ng to take a closer look at the defects in Hong Kong’s education system. EJ Insight supports efforts to help people deal with depression and related issues.

By Kelvin Lee Recent suicide cases among primary and secondary students have drawn fresh scrutiny to Hong Kong’s education system. Parent groups pressed for the removal of Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA), a standardized test aimed at evaluating school performance, dubbing the exam a major source of stress and anxiety among students. Lawmakers and parents at Thursday’s anti-TSA campaign event. Photo: Lau Siu-lai, via Facebook. The Education Bureau disagrees, and fought tooth and nail for the survival of the exam. It went as far as to change the name of the exam from TSA to Basic Competency Assessments (BCA), even after then-Chief-Executive-elect Carrie Lam signalled her intention to suspend the exam. While the outrage of parents is understandable, perhaps even justified, the Education Bureau’s strong desire to monitor school performance is in fact, quite justifiable. After all, as the regulatory body that oversees education institutions, it is responsible for ensuring school quality. TSA/BCA currently evaluates school performance by measuring student academic proficiency. Much like any other public examination in Hong Kong, this means looking at the absolute score a student achieves in the exam, and absolute score alone. If the score passes a threshold set by the Bureau, the student is deemed “proficient”. If enough students hit “proficient”, the school is deemed “proficient”. However, students don’t all start with the same level of academic mastery. In other words, the exam is not a level playing field. It is impossible for educators to set a one-size-fit-all proficiency target that is fair – rigorous enough for everyone, yet attainable enough for everyone. A uniform threshold almost guarantees that some will find it not rigorous enough, while others will find it not attainable enough. This means: some will struggle with all their might, while some, as my high school teacher would say, cruise through the exam. File photo: Labour Party. But more troublingly is how this “proficiency gap” came to be. Citing Albert Shanker Institute, The 74’s Matt Barnum noted that only 20% of “variation in student achievement is explained by differences in schools”, and that “out-of-school factors, like poverty”, have a “significant effect on learning”. Further exacerbating this effect is the failings of our education system. Most so-called elite schools, which were originally public, made the switch to the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS). This has led to the blanket exclusion of poor kids from elite schools. With endowment funds of some of these semi-private DSS schools hitting more than HK$30 million, one can only imagine the uphill battle to keep up with the proficiency target for schools with less resources and more disadvantaged kids, and feel pity for the students who have fallen victim to a system stacked against them. With so many factors affecting a student’s abilities, the report concludes, implementing a proficiency-based exam will only “reward schools for the students they take in”, but not how they teach. “Impact of TSA-related stress on our bodies” poster and items commemorating students who ended their lives. Photo: Parents United of Hong Kong. Perhaps it is time for the Bureau to rethink its approach to school performance exams. The ‘growth’ approach Educators have long debated the “how” in evaluating school performance, and according to Brookings Institute, there is a “growing consensus” among educators that an approach which measures student academic growth is more appropriate. One of the reasons is because it improves the “proficiency gap”. By setting rigorous and “long-range” goals that span through multiple school years, the American Institute of Research found that teachers can bring “students who perform far below proficiency to grade level”. According to the institute this might even close the “achievement gap” between rich and poor kids. But perhaps the most convincing argument for a growth-based system is its ability to recognise that the definition of a “rigorous yet attainable” proficiency level varies from student to student. In a growth-based system, a teacher does not have to force students to do an unreasonable amount of exam drilling exercises, just to make sure students hit that arbitrary but all-important proficiency target. With a system that “recognizes teachers’ efforts with all students”, a teacher can set “a realistic learning goal for all students”. A sign rejecting the TSA exam during the 2017 July 1 rally. Photo: HKFP/Ellie Ng. Indeed, there are drawbacks to growth-based school performance exams: the risk of not reaching “proficiency” at the end of the 12-year schooling comes to mind. That is why it is also necessary to have proficiency-based in-school and public exams, which Hong Kong is not short of, to serve as counterbalances to growth-based examinations. While it is unfortunate that it took the tragedies of student suicide to bring renewed attention to pressures students face in school, a closer examination behind the causes of these pressures must continue. Changing a defective examination system should only be the first step. Kelvin Lee is a business student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.  Comments

Suicides rising among youth, survey finds  The number of young people committing suicide has continued to increase, data analysis by a suicide prevention centre shows.  
The Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention estimates that the suicide rate for people aged between 15 and 24 was 8.9 per 100,000 last year – up from 8.4 per 100,000 the year before.  
It said according to the coroner's court, 69 people under the age of 24 took their own lives last year.  
The suicide rate of people younger than 15 went up from 0.2 per 100,000 in 2015 to 0.5 per 100,000 last year.  
But the center said it expects the situation to improve over time after the government rolled out a number of prevention measures last year.  
The center said the overall number of suicide cases has been decreasing over the years, and the elderly remain the age group with the highest suicide rate. But it also said the overall suicide rate in Hong Kong is on the lower side when compared globally. 
The director of the centre, Paul Yip, said many NGOs provide support services for people who lose their loved ones to suicide.  
He added that those around the bereaved should show sympathy as it takes a long time for people to recover.-RTHK

A 15-year-old secondary school student has taken his own life on Sunday morning. He was the third to die in four attempted suicides by Hong Kong students within eight days. The boy died at Kam Tai Court, a public housing estate in Ma On Shan around 9am on Sunday. Kam Tai Court. Photo: Chong Fat via Wikicommons. HK01 reported that his suicide may be related to worries over academic grades, as his secondary school was about to announce results. Last Wednesday morning, a 12-year-old student attempted to take her own life at Lower Wong Tai Sin Estate, also reportedly due to academic pressure. She was prevented from doing so by firefighters and policemen. The latest incidents follow two student deaths from suicide immediately after the end of the Chinese New Year holidays. A 16-year-old died on February 5 in Ma On Shan, while a 13-year-old died on February 6 in Tsing Yi. Kam Tai Court on Sunday. Photo: Apple Daily. 35 cases of student suicide were reported last year.

A 15-year-old secondary student plunged to his death on Sunday in Ma On Shan, the third such case in eight days. The boy is believed to have jumped off the roof of Kam Pong House in Kam Tai Court around 10 a.m., am730 reports.. Police said the victim might have committed suicide due to pressure from schoolwork. He was studying at a Band 1 secondary school in Ma On Shan which was about to hand out report cards, according to Apple Daily. The victim texted his parents that he wanted to kill himself at around 9 a.m. on Sunday but they could not locate him. The incident was the latest in a string of deaths by young students. A 16-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl fell to their deaths on Feb. 5 and 6, respectively, while a 12-year-old girl was saved by firemen when she tried to jump off a building in Wong Tai Sin on Feb. 8. Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong Center for Suicide Research and Prevention said the incidents could be related to pressure from studies. He said the victims also might have been having emotional problems or poor interpersonal relationships. Hsu Siu-man, supervisor of the Youth Wellness Centers of the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, said students could be copying suicides from previous cases. People should talk to others when they feel they are under pressure, Hsu said, adding that academic results are only part of a person’s life. She said parents should also pay close attention to any abnormal behavior by their children. EJ Insight supports efforts to help people deal with depression and related issues.

By Odilon Couzin Last week, in response to criticism from parents, teachers and many others, the chairman of the EDB’s Committee on Prevention of Student Suicide, Professor Paul Yip, wrote a column in SCMP defending the committee’s recent report. In it, he wrote that those who testified in Legco last week were “misinterpreting” the report’s message, that they were trying to “only blame the school system” rather than recognizing the “complexity of the suicide situation.” This couldn’t be further from the truth. All serious research on suicide recognizes that there are usually multiple factors, nobody is suggesting otherwise, and this is a crude attempt to discredit anyone who dares to criticize the report. A student suicide protest. Photo: Albert Chan. True, many of those who spoke up in Legco focused on the intense pressure that students experience in Hong Kong schools, but their testimony was largely a response to the clear attempt by the EDB and its hand-picked committee members to downplay or even deny a link between schoolwork and tests and the sort of psychological pressures that can lead to self-harm and suicide among students. This is not a misinterpretation. The report goes to great pains to avoid saying that academic pressure is an important factor in student suicide. It ignores much academic research and even Hong Kong government reports that contradict this conclusion. The wording of the report’s denial is chosen carefully, as if written by a lawyer or politician trying to squirm out of a tight corner. For instance, it claims “there is no substantial direct link between student suicides and the education system.” But there are plenty of links, and  a mountain of clear evidence linking school and test pressure to student suicide. The Social Welfare Department issued four “Child Mortality Review” papers covering the years 2006 – 2011 that showed schoolwork pressures were linked to between 29% and 42% of youth suicides. According to the Committee’s report, the EDB’s own data showed that 24% of Primary and Secondary school students who committed suicide were known to be worried about their academic performance, but this is somehow ignored in the report’s conclusion. Surveys conducted among Hong Kong students show an alarmingly high percentage consider suicide, and that the biggest sources of pressure in their lives are tests and homework. Finally, many works of academic research have shown there is a strong link between school pressure and student suicide. Those who spoke up last week were not misinterpreting the report. For parents, teachers, and so many others who care deeply about the well-being of Hong Kong’s children, this sort of blatant doublespeak is simply not acceptable. Photo: Apple Daily. While the report makes a number of useful recommendations about increasing budgets for psychological support to students and parents, expanding service referral via the schools, and educating society about the risk of suicide, it fails to make any serious recommendations on how to reduce pressure on students. Like a 2011 EDB guide on preventing student suicide, the report focuses on measures to help students learn how to deal with extreme pressure rather than trying to address the source of the pressure itself. In fact, the solution is there for all to see.  In 2000, the Education Commission issued a comprehensive Education Reform proposal. That proposal called for a “paradigm shift” away from high-pressure tests, cramming, and rote memorization, and said that less testing and a “flexible and open curriculum framework” would produce better long-term educational outcomes. While EDB officials say this is still their blueprint for education reform and pay lip service to the goals of a balanced and flexible education, they seem to have moved in the opposite direction. Eddie Ng Hak-kim (left) and Paul Yip Siu-fai (right). Photo: GovHK. Yip writes that we should “look for evidence-based measures to make our work more effective and to ensure the school system helps those in need.” We couldn’t agree more, and we believe the evidence in this case is strong and clear: excessive testing, homework, and academic pressure may produce high test results, but they are overwhelming  Hong Kong’s children and this must be faced head-on. A frank and honest public discussion, followed by comprehensive reform of the education system is urgently required, because all Hong Kong students are at risk.

Cold-blooded trolls mock grieving mother Online trolls hurled verbal abuse at Peter Poon's grieving mother, Christine Choi, yesterday. And posters were put up on the notice board at the Education University of Hong Kong "congratulating" Choi on her  son "going to heaven." The president of the university slammed two students for putting up the posters, adding that a full investigation will be launched. Mental health professionals and commentators condemned the "cold blooded comments," pleading for the public to show some empathy for Choi who had lost a son. On social media, one troll said the son's death was "karma slapped in her face," referring to education policies they were unhappy with. "Instant karma is a f***ing b*tch," said Facebook user Gravit Zen. Alvin Ng said that Poon took his life due to "poor life planning" in a take on former education secretary Eddie Ng Hak-kim, who had linked poor life planning to a worrying spate of student suicides. Hong Kong Unison founder Fermi Wong Wai-fun, a social worker, said: "Political disagreement should not justify gloating over someone's death. "What Choi's family needs now is empathy and condolences. It is humanity and respect to others on the basic level." Ip Kin-yuen, chief executive Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union, who defeated Choi in the September 2016 Legislative Council election, said: "I call on them [trolls] to stop and recall their comments." Political commentator Ivan Choy Chi-keung said: "People online don't need to take responsibility for their words, thus people expose their angelic and devilish sides - and this time it's more of the devil. "Of course, social divide played a part in it, but I believe the internet exposes this evil side in many parts of the world." Some netizens also mocked the former education secretary Eddie Ng Hak- kim when his mother died in March and his wife died in June. Paul Yip Siu-fai, psychiatrist and director of the University of Hong Kong Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, agreed most internet comments were inappropriate. As for Peter Poon's death, Yip admitted it was extremely difficult to recover from traumatic accidents. "Poon had made lots of high accomplishments before, yet he was struck with the accident," Yip said. "It was inevitable to feel frustrated that you could not do what you used to do, like you were at a trough." He advised those suffering major life changes to try to reset more realistic goals. Yip also warned against the impact of sensationalization of news on those living with "black dog" depression. "Media should refrain from over- reporting suicide news," Yip said. Today's Standard

A 17-year-old student from Guangdong has been arrested after allegedly organising a chat room group that disseminated messages on the “Blue Whale” suicide game. According to US-backed Radio Free Europe, the Blue Whale Challenge is a “game” where teenage participants are ordered to perform one task every day – usually involving self-harm – ending with their suicides after 50 days. It reportedly originated on Russian social media networks, but there have been reports of the trend emerging around the world. Zhanjiang, Guangdong. Photo: Google Maps. The Beijing News reported that a teenage surnamed Xu, the founder of a chat group for buying and selling software and clothes, was detained for posts he made on WeChat related to the game on Friday. The high school student told Zhanjiang police that he was invited into a chat group named “Blue Whale suicide game” on May 9. He said he left the group after viewing materials related to the trend for around 10 minutes. The police said he then initially posted two messages related to the Blue Whale Challenge into his own group in order to attract a larger audience. The group soon expanded from 300 to 500 members. Xu admitted to posting photographs of self-mutilation that he downloaded from the internet into the group, said the police. “Congratulations to 11 members of the group for completing a mission from the Blue Whale Challenge,” police said he wrote. In the early hours of May 12, Xu was detained on suspicion of “spreading extremism.” The Zhanjiang police confirmed his detention on its WeChat public account on Tuesday. According to the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, the dissemination of terrorist or extremist materials is punishable by a prison term of less than five years in minor cases. Severe cases are punishable by a prison term of over five years. File photo: Pixabay. It is unclear whether any cases of self-harm or suicide in China or Hong Kong have been linked to the Blue Whale Challenge.

On Saturday, however, an anonymous writer on local student Facebook community Schools Secrets claimed that three friends were spotted with arm injuries a few days after they wrote the same cryptic Facebook posts: “#imawhale.” If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255.

Experts are urging parents and schools to keep a strong vigil on children after a sick social media game that has been linked to multiple teen suicides in Russia seems to have made its way into Hong Kong. The call for caution comes after a netizen who claimed to be a student of the University of Hong Kong said in a Facebook post that three of his friends were suspected to be participating in the Blue Whale Challenge, also known as the Blue Whale suicide game. According to the post, the three friends not only wrote “I am a whale” on their Facebook pages, but were also seen with their left hands wrapped in bandages a few days later, suggesting injuries. Expressing alarm, the netizen called on young people not to try the game, news website hk01.com reports. Blue Whale Challenge, which originated in Russia, is an online game in which participants are purportedly assigned a curator who suggests they commit various acts of self-harm on a daily basis for 50 days. It also goes by other names including “A Silent House”, “A Sea Of Whales” and “Wake Me Up At 4:20am”. On the final day, participants are urged to commit suicide so as to win the game, a sick challenge that has reportedly led to a number of young people ending up injured or dead around the world. The creator of the brain wash game, a 21-year-old Russian man named Philipp Budeikin, was arrested by police last year, but that has not put an end to the Blue Whale game in the cyber world. Professor Yip Siu-fai, director of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Center for Suicide and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, said he has been aware of the influences brought by the game. Besides calling on the government to be vigilant, Yip urged parents and schools to put up their guard and watch if those under their care suffer from any strange injuries or show behavioral changes. The game’s potential harmful consequences should not be underestimated, Yip said, warning youngsters not to even try the online game just out of curiosity. A senior social worker told Headline Daily that Blue Whale Challenge is a suicide-promoting endeavor rather than a just game, as the online challenge systematically asks players to hurt themselves. He asked all sections of society to stay on high alert to prevent the game from expanding online and prompting young people to form groups to commit suicide. - Contact us at [email protected] TL/AC/RC 
A 19-year-old Baptist University student from Tai Po took her own life on Monday afternoon – the third such case in four days. The incident was possibly linked to academic pressure, and there were no suspicious circumstances, the police said. File photo: Wikicommons. At around noon last Friday, a Secondary Five student took their own life. According to the police, the 16-year-old was unhappy because of school work. On the same day, a Form Two student took her own life at her apartment block in Tin Shui Wai. The victim had suffered from mood swings owing to extracurricular commitments, the local newspaper Ming Pao reported. See also: HKFP’s comprehensive guide to mental health services in Hong Kong In March, a copy of the Education Bureau’s “no-suicide contract” was widely circulated on the internet, after seven student suicide cases emerged in the space of nine days. The document came from an eBook published by the Bureau aimed at preventing student suicide. As debate flared online, HK Psychologists Concern said that contracts are a “commonly used and effective method” for therapy sessions. It urged netizens to stop criticising the contract so that students who seek help will not lose confidence in the document. No-suicide contract. Photo: Gov HK. James Hon Lin-shan, the former chairman of the Council on Professional Conduct in Education, wrote on Monday in an Apple Daily column that the root cause of youth suicide is the Bureau’s indifference to students’ academic stress brought about by the imbalance and failure of the education curriculum. “Changing the government and education system is the only way to eradicate the problem from its root,” the column read. Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim said in October that poor life planning is a reason students take their own lives. His comments were based on a report from the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides.

Flu fears over schoolgirl's death Health authorities are trying to establish whether the death of a Heep Yunn School Primary Five student could be flu-related. The girl, surnamed Lau, aged about 10, is reported to have suffered from acute septicemia and pneumonia after catching the flu.  In a circular sent to parents, the school said Lau died on Sunday midnight. It did not specify the cause, but stated that a team has been formed to counsel students.  "The school has set up a crisis management team following the death of the student. Educational psychologists, teachers and social workers will provide emotional support to students if needed," the school in Kowloon City said in the circular. The girl fell sick last Monday and saw a doctor the next day. She went to a private hospital on Wednesday where she was admitted until she was referred to a public hospital for an emergency operation on Thursday, according to the circular. The school refused to comment on the incident yesterday, citing privacy issues.  A spokesman for the Centre for Health Protection spokesman said it had approached the school regarding the issue, and no outbreak of infectious disease had been reported there so far.  Flu activity in Hong Kong currently is at a low level. Infectious disease specialist Joseph Tsang Kay-yan said it is very common for the flu virus to trigger secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumonia.  According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: "Flu virus infection of the respiratory tract can trigger an extreme inflammatory response in the body and can lead to sepsis, the body's life-threatening response to infection." Tsang urged the public to receive the flu vaccine ahead of the winter.  "People should still get vaccinated even though there was an alleged vaccine mismatch before," he said. "Regardless of the coverage, there is still a cross-protection effect." The government procured 460,000 doses of vaccine for the winter flu vaccination program that began on October 18.  It contains the Hong Kong H3N2- like virus based on the World Health Organization recommendation in February for the northern hemisphere, in which Hong Kong falls. But a WHO meeting in Melbourne in September decided that for the southern hemisphere's 2018 flu season, the vaccine mix should do away with the Hong Kong strain, and replace it with the Singapore-like H3N2 virus which emerged in the city-state in 2016. The move had put many in fear, as the recent summer flu peak season, the fiercest on record, killed 431 people including three children. Today's Standard

Rape-bid student found hanged A top Secondary Four student at an elite Kwun Tong school accused of attempted rape was found hanged in the drainage room of a Sau Mau Ping housing estate yesterday. Police were closing in on the 17-year- old student of a Band-One school about 5am yesterday when they found him dead in Po Tat Estate.  Police suspect he hanged himself  using his backpack strings. Police said a wound on the hand of the boy, identified as Doing To Cheuk- wing, matched the one made by the victim when she was attacked early on Saturday. Police also said a reusable bag found in the boy's backpack may also be related to the case. "We found in the deceased's room a T-shirt and the shorts the suspect was said to have worn when attempting to rape the woman, and there is a bite on the back of his right hand, which matched the wound the victim made on the suspect when struggling," Sau Mau Ping District acting superintendent Yin Hiu-yu said. Yin said there was no suicide note at the scene but there was nothing suspicious about To's death. Police have so far not been able to contact To's family and Yin said they may not be in Hong Kong. The Kowloon East regional crime unit is handling the case. At 2am on Saturday, a 19-year-old was returning to her Tin Wan House home in Shun Tin Estate after jogging along Shun On Road when she was attacked from behind, dragged and had her head covered with a reusable bag. She screamed, struggled and bit the attacker's hand, forcing him to flee. Police classified the case as attempted rape and said they were looking for a 1.7-meter tall suspect who wore glasses and was wearing a dark- colored T-shirt and shorts and was aged about 20. To was a top student in a Band-One secondary school. One of his schoolmates said that while he was silent and an introvert, he had good academic results. The schoolmate said it was hard to believe that To was involved in an attempted rape case. A schoolmate who studied with him in Sau Mau Ping Catholic Primary School said To was seriously sick for several months and had to repeat one school year, making him older than his classmates. It was believed that To lived with his mother and younger brother in Po Tat Estate and that the mother worked as a waitress in a restaurant in the estate. To's younger brother studies in the same school and also had outstanding results in both Secondary Two and Secondary Three. It was said that his mother and younger brother had recently gone to the mainland. Kwun Tong District councilor Mok Kin-shing, elected from the Shun Tin constituency, said the attempted rape occurred at a quiet spot of the estate. Mok said he could not conclude from individual events that public security had worsened but there must be room to improve security. "I will also suggest to the Housing Authority to add more surveillance cameras within the estate," he said. The estate was also the scene of a flasher but there have been no sightings in recent months, he said. Today's Standard

A 16-year-old secondary school student fell to his death in Tuen Mun around midnight on Tuesday, hk01.com reports. A passerby saw the boy lying unconscious on a container truck at Rose Dale Garden residential estate at 133 Castle Peak Road, and called the police. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Police found what is believed to be a suicide note beside the boy’s body; it said he hoped his parents would not blame him and that he had gone in search of the real meaning of life. Preliminary investigation showed that the boy fell from the building, hitting the truck’s container before bouncing into the gap behind the driving cabin. His parents did not know of his death until police officers knocked on their door. He was an only child. The boy was a secondary five student at CCC Tam Lee Lai Fun Memorial Secondary School, Apple Daily reported. Sources said he appeared to have a good relationship with his parents and had good grades at school. He had always been interested in science and innovative designs, and had wanted to be a scientist. He had invented a can opener for people with physical and motor problems, which had won him the top prize at a school invention competition. He also had numerous awards in other science and invention competitions, such as the Hong Kong Youth Science and Innovation Competition, a robot competition and the Soong Ching Ling Young Inventors Award. Tang Chi-kwong, assistant principal at his secondary school, said the boy had conducted himself normally during the first day of classes. Tang also said he did not believe that school could be a source of stress because the boy had always been a good student. The boy had a deformed left hand, but Tang said that did not seem to bother the boy at all. His teachers and classmates also did not notice anything unusual in his behavior prior to his death. Tang said the school would be in touch with the boy’s family and offer assistance. EJ Insight supports efforts to help people deal with depression and related issues.

By the Association Concerning the Legal Rights of Victims of Domestic Violence A murder-suicide case shocked Hong Kong last week. Last Monday, a man allegedly killed his wife at a luxury apartment building in Yau Ma Tei before taking his own life. The police said the husband had moved out of their home on Friday after the wife discovered he had been cheating and demanded a divorce. The Coronation in Yau Ma Tei. Photo: Wikicommons. Domestic violence in the city remains one of Hong Kong’s most neglected problems and unfortunately, also its most hidden. Yet, the media coverage of the murder-suicide case highlights a critical lack of understanding about the issue. As the horrific news about the young couple, who were both civil servants, gripped the city, reports speculated that the act of violence was the inevitable consequence of the wife earning a higher salary than the husband. The front-page story of Headline Daily on Tuesday, 5 September 2017, was titled: “Wife’s salary is more than double her husband’s. Wife in a higher position is a recipe for a tragedy.” News website HK01.com also linked the murder-suicide to the wife’s high salary. In a story published on 4 September, it quoted Szeto Hon-ming, a senior social worker, who said a wife shouldn’t “injure the pride” of the husband. He also advised wives who earned more than their husband not to use “terms that may undermine men’s self-esteem.” Today's Headline Daily: "Wife's salary is more than double her husband's. Wife being in a higher position is recipe for tragedy" ??? pic.twitter.com/oI0ydID6hB — Holmes Chan (@holmeschan_) September 6, 2017  Media ethics exact a higher standard of reporting than what is sadly on display from the headlines and stories which have emerged over the course of the week. The reports have irresponsibly showcased and perpetuated a sexist narrative which blames the victim. Although the homicide rate in Hong Kong remains comparatively low given the size of our population, the number of domestic murder-suicides among homicides features prominently. This is no cause for comfort but rather, calls for targeted approaches for prevention by frontline personnel who need to understand that such incidents are often the breaking point in a relationship likely to have been peppered by escalating violence earlier on. The majority of the victims are women, and the perpetrators are usually their partners or former partners. Hong Kong — along with Japan — has the highest rate of female homicide victims in the world: women comprise 52.9 per cent of the total homicide victims in these two jurisdictions, followed by South Korea at 52.5 per cent. Research shows that women are at a heightened risk of becoming victims of violence during periods of conflict in their relationship, particularly when they try to end their relationship. In a separate case also on Monday last week, a woman was raped by her estranged husband and his friend at her home in Sha Tin after she refused to reconcile with him. File photo: Pexels/freestocks.org. Domestic homicide, murder-suicide cases and other forms of intimate partner violence don’t happen in a vacuum. Multiple incidents of abuse occur before a woman is killed or harmed and before such instances come fully to light. Leaving a relationship is the most dangerous time for domestic violence victims. To lay blame on victims and labelling them as a “scorned wife” or “cold” for refusing to reconcile with a partner perpetuates patriarchy at the heart of which lies gender inequality and oppression. It is high time that Hong Kong acknowledges this reality as the root cause of violence against women. The media have the responsibility to report stories about violence against women in a manner that is fair and facilitates the public’s proper understanding of the issue and educates them on the complexities of such occurrences. As Mary Barry, chief executive of Our Watch, an Australian non-profit, recently said: “There is a clear link between media reporting and community attitudes towards violence against women.” Apart from journalists, we also call on those who work in the front line, from social workers to healthcare professionals to police, to have a deeper understanding about violence against women. This warrants regular, up-to-date training and development of skills to effectively handle complaints of violence and in particular, to offer follow-up services to prevent retaliation or escalation in the future. Sadly, these continue to be sorely lacking at this moment.

Ma Rongrong’s labour pains were unbearable. For hours she had begged for a C-section to ease her agony. After multiple requests were refused, she jumped five floors from a hospital window in northern China to her death. Ma’s family and her doctors have blamed each other for denying her the surgery that could have eased her suffering. Photo: Weibo. The tragedy has attracted intense attention in China, with many wondering how Ma could be denied such a common procedure. There is no clear answer, but the incident has sparked a national discussion on everything from the high cost of health care and patients’ rights to the dangers of traditional Chinese family values. The conversation reached fever pitch this week after leaked security footage showing Ma on her knees in front of her family in a hospital corridor went viral. In response to the uproar, the official People’s Daily said in an editorial that no matter who is ultimately to blame, the incident should serve as a national wake-up call. “It is necessary to pay more attention to pregnant women’s feelings, and pay greater respect to their autonomy,” it said. “We need to have more empathetic understanding and care for them. We cannot only think about policies and interests.” Trading blame  The hospital and Ma’s family have traded blame for refusing her request for a Caesarean, presumably provoking her to kill herself rather than continue suffering through an excruciating labour. The hospital has said it recommended Ma undergo the procedure, but that she and her husband insisted on natural birth in the belief it was better for the child. As evidence, the hospital posted Ma’s surgery log on its official social media account, showing the family had denied her requests. Ma had signed an authorisation granting her husband the right to make medical decisions on her behalf, it said, adding the hospital therefore “had no right to change the delivery method without (his) consent”. Photo: Weibo, But Ma’s husband, Yan Zhuangzhuang, told the Beijing Youth Daily that he had agreed to his wife’s surgery: it was the doctor who said it was unnecessary. Under Chinese law, the decision should have been made by the person herself, according to Feng Lihua, an expert on medical disputes at Beijing’s Zhongdun Law Firm. “It cannot be authorised by other people,” he told AFP. Online uproar  The controversy has been hotly discussed for days, and by the end of the week the hashtag “Yulin pregnant woman jumps to death” was the third highest trending topic on the Twitter-like Weibo. The incident is under police investigation, but the question for many is why Ma was not allowed to choose her own course of care. Some commenters argued the family was not able or willing to pay for the surgery — a common problem in a country where anything other than the most basic medical care can be out of reach for the average person. Others have wondered whether government policy was at least partly to blame for Ma’s death. China has long kept a tight rein on women’s reproductive rights, sometimes using force. After decades of promoting a strict “one-child” policy to limit its booming population, China has reversed course, pushing women to have two children in hopes of rejuvenating the country’s greying labour force. While C-sections are favoured in China as a less painful option, the government has pressured hospitals to reduce the Caesarean rate which is among the world’s highest. “The hospital wants to limit C-sections and the families don’t want to spend money,” said one commenter, airing a view that was widely expressed on social media. “This type of system and this type of family produced this type of tragedy.” The government has also pushed a return to more traditional, Confucian values that privilege the family over the individual. What that means for childbirth is that husbands and their mothers — not women themselves — are more likely to call the shots. “Why can’t the hospital carry out a C-section upon her request?” wrote one commenter on Weibo. “Simply because her family does not agree? What kind of rule is this?” If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255.

Nearly 10 per cent of primary school students demonstrate symptoms of serious depression that require clinical attention, a new study has shown. Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service distributed questionnaires among 1,301 primary three to primary six students across 14 schools between January and March this year. The NGO estimated that over 33,000 of the 349,000 primary school students in the city suffer from clinical depression and require therapy and treatment. Clinical psychologist Ester Lee. Photo: RTHK screenshot. Over a fifth of students said that they often experience stress from their heavy homework load, academic performance and preparation for secondary school. “Children may not use the same methods as adults in expressing their inner thoughts – so we would look at more extrinsic factors, such as those relating to the physical body. For example, their sleep may be affected: they may sleep too much or experience insomnia, or they may have poor sleeping quality and have a lot of nightmares,” said clinical psychologist Ester Lee Ming-lam a press conference on Sunday. Lee added that some children may also suffer from stomachaches, diarrhea or other health problems. See also: HKFP’s comprehensive guide to mental health services in Hong Kong Other behaviours to watch out for include instances of the student’s academic results taking a turn for the worse; if they refuse to hand in homework; or when they show reluctance in going to school, Lee said. The study also found that a lack of psychological resilience – meaning the ability to face pressure and handle emotions – was one of the biggest factors in childhood depression, and that these children tend to avoid things that trigger negative emotions and take to the extremity. Photo: GovHK. The NGO recommends that parents talk to their children more and spend more time with them, as well as stay calm and take note of each other’s emotions when responding to them. Social welfare sector lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun told Chief Executive Carrie Lam last month that there have been over 72 suicides among young people, from primary school students to postgraduate students, over the past two years.

Depression 'hitting 10pc' of primary kids Children as young as six were found to be developing symptoms of depression, while the youngest case to be diagnosed with the mental illness was 10, according to Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service. The non-government organization surveyed 1,301 primary school students aged nine to 13 from 14 schools in Hong Kong in the first three months of the year. Almost 10 percent of the students  showed serious depression symptoms and needed clinical attention, according to the findings. It was also found that 21.7 percent of interviewees reported that they often felt stressed, which the NGO said was 5.5 percentage points more than last year and a three-year high. The most frequently reported stressors were heavy schoolwork, choice of secondary school and poorer than expected academic results, it said. While most students were found to not suffer from depression, 13.2 percent were troubled by depression symptoms, including 9.7 percent that required clinical attention. "Estimating on the primary student population of this academic year, which is 349,008, the depressive tendency over 33,000 primary students has reached clinical level," a spokeswoman said. More than 10 percent of students experienced symptoms such as fatigue and reported feeling useless, she said. Other symptoms included reduced interest, loss of appetite and weight. The NGO found that the lack of psychological resilience was the most prominent risk factor for depression among students. Ester Lee Ming-lam, a clinical psychologist at the NGO, said children with this condition are more prone to avoid and repress unpleasant memories. But she said this could lead to more negative thoughts and affect their emotion and behavior, leading to serious consequences such as suicide. Lee urged parents to interact with their children as it builds a better bond and can dissipate any pent-up emotions the youngsters may be withholding.  She also said parents should not focus solely on academic results and should look to nurture other values such as confidence, empathy and creativity. The NGO said parents have a role in spotting the symptoms of depression as children may lack the confidence to open up about their psychological problems. Today's Standard

By Florence Lau “Look, teacher, the dog’s in front! It’s a winner. But, that boy? He’s behind. Such a loser,” my tutee noted as we read children’s book We’re Going On A Bear Hunt. “It doesn’t matter who’s in front. They’re a team; they’re working together. See? There’s no winner or loser.” My tutee nodded dismissively, shrugging off my efforts to convince him that there really wasn’t a winner or a loser in this story. He continued to make similar remarks as we went on, saying things like “look, the dog’s still the winner,” or “the baby’s at the end again – he lost.” File photo: Chspf via Wikimedia Commons. With every comment, my heart sank deeper. Here I was, with a Primary One student, and the only thing that he noticed about the characters was whether they were winning or losing. I kept thinking: “Why is a six-year-old so concerned about who’s a winner or a loser even though the story isn’t about a competition?” When I was six, I would have probably been thinking about how much I’d want to be on a bear hunt with my friends and the many adventures we could be on. So, why was he thinking this way? Well, the answer’s simple. The notorious parenting methods of Hong Kong parents, which are “helpful” in aiding our children to succeed in the Hong Kong educational system, have trained us to become numb to anything but success. When you ask Hong Kong children what they are most proud of, they will often tell you that it’s being among the top three in the class, or winning the championship in a Mathalon. When you ask them what they do during their free time, most of them say that they have no free time, and comment on how busy they are, citing their jam-packed schedules of Chinese, Math, and English tutorials, along with some sports, dance, or music classes. When asked whether they are enjoying those classes, they fall silent, or shake their head and whisper: “my parents are making me do it.” Now, let’s step back and ask ourselves – is this normal? File photo: Apple Daily. The average adult in Hong Kong works for 50.1 hours a week. Given that, let’s figure out the average amount of time children spend working. School starts at 8am and ends at 3pm, making that about seven hours of school time. These kids would also need to go to after-school tutorials to brush up on their mathematics or linguistic skills, each around 1.5 hours. Of course, we can’t exclude the five to seven homework assignments that they get each day, which, on good days, would hopefully take up three hours to complete. Adding it all up, a child would spend 11.5 hours per day working on weekdays. Now, we also have to account for their weekend classes because, naturally, children shouldn’t rest on weekends. Weekends are for levelling up: taking extracurricular classes and squeezing in additional English or Chinese tutorials. I mean, you shouldn’t waste any chance to boost their value in the Hong Kong educational market, right? Enrol them in a dancing, swimming, or piano class. Though one should probably add in lessons for a more exotic musical instrument, since piano classes are the norm now. Assuming that a child takes two classes on the weekends, each two hours in length, he/she would be working for 61.5 hours per week – which is effectively 11.4 hours more than the average adult. File photo: Apple Daily. Why are our children working even more hours than us? Just because their work doesn’t pay and there’s no “boss” looming over them, does that make it any less stressful and overwhelming? You might think: “I’m only helping my children succeed – the more qualifications they have, the higher they score, the greater the chance they will have at getting into a good university, and the greater the chance they will end up with a successful career.” But I’m afraid that is a misbelief. Constantly encouraging them to score better than the kid next door and reinforcing concepts about how important it is to beat the other guy is not going to help them go far in life. It will only push them to become socially awkward and more secluded from other people. Punishing them when they don’t reach your expectations isn’t going to help them improve next time; rather, it will harm your relationship with them and make them products of a system that trains them to work only under external motivation. I am a product of these cruel methods. I had alternating Chinese and English tutorials every day after school, dance classes on Fridays, art classes on Saturdays, and additional Chinese or English lessons over the weekends. File photo: Apple Daily. Then after Primary Three, my parents changed their parenting methods. Though my academic scores weren’t as high as they were back in elementary school, I was happier, had better relationships with people, and kind of turned out okay in the end (I guess). I’m not trying to tell you that it is fine for a kid to get an “F” on a test. But there are many methods to encourage them to improve – more than just locking them up in the kitchen until they promise to score better. And to do well in school, a child doesn’t have to attend tutorials constantly, especially when he or she is not even struggling in the subject. See also: Hong Kong school kids’ happiness hits record low – survey Nothing is more important than letting your children know that you are there to support them no matter what, regardless of whether they win or lose in a competition. While there is still time, teach them love and kindness, rather than rivalry and competitiveness; let them know that there is more to life than “winning” before they are whisked into its harsh reality.

Suicide-bid son has mental issues A former social worker who allegedly killed his mother before attempting suicide may have been suffering from depression, sources said. Police found psychiatric drugs when they searched through the flat at Kwai Shing East Estate in Kwai Chung where the 77-year-old woman was found dead on Sunday. Sources said the suspect, surnamed  Lee, 34, had been a patient at Kwai Chung Hospital's West Kowloon Psychiatric Centre and was last seen by a doctor late last month.  At the last appointment, Lee was given the all-clear and was due for reassessment in February, sources said. It is understood police have requested Lee's medical files from the Hospital Authority.  Lee is alleged to have almost beheaded his mother, a patient with chronic health issues.  According to neighbors, Lee was her caregiver and had complained about stress and the lack of supportive services. Two domestic workers were employed by the family to care for the patient but were on leave on Sunday, police said. Around noon, Lee jumped from the flat on the 16th floor but his fall was broken by a tree and he remained conscious. He was rushed to Princess Margaret Hospital with serious injuries. Doctors deemed he was unfit for questioning yesterday, and it is understood that police have not yet taken his statement. Sources said officers are also looking into Lee's financial records. Lee and his friend co-founded an estate management company in 2011, but he was not able to work full-time as he had to care for his sick mother. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said the family had never applied for long-term care or "aging in place" services, according to Social Welfare Department records. "In my understanding, the old lady was taken care of by two foreign domestic helpers, but still the incident happened, so it's not clear whether the problem was inadequate support in care  we must learn the lesson and see what needs improving," he said. Cheung said he was saddened by the incident and the government will try to provide better support to caregivers in the hope of relieving stress. He said the government will provide more elderly home places and day-care quotas, so as to meet the demand of an aging population. He also said the government will improve its residential respite service that allows an elderly person in need of care to be taken into a home for a few days to give the caregiver a rest and relieve stress. Kwai Tsing District Council member Rayman Chow Wai-hung said he had known Lee for years, and that he had vented dissatisfaction with the government's elderly-care services before. Speaking on a radio program, Chow said Lee was an able problem-solver and he was shocked to learn about the incident.  He also said Lee told him his mother disliked elderly homes. Today's Standard

Poor life planning is a reason students take their own lives, the Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim said on Friday. His comments were based on a report from the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides which will be submitted to the Education Bureau at the end of the month. “The subjects that students picked at university might not have been what they were interested in, or what they were good at,” Ng said. “That is why good life planning is important.” Secretary for Education Eddie Ng. File Photo: Stand News. The committee was set up in March after seven student suicide cases emerged in the space of just nine days. See also: Gov’t should reflect upon student suicides, not blame media, says trade union lawmaker “They might not have been able to stand the pressure from having to meet their own expectations, their family’s expectations, and their peer’s expectations,” Ng added.

Group seeks summit on suicides An alliance to help prevent student suicides urged the incoming chief executive to set up a "summit" of government and civil groups to prevent the loss of young lives. About 10 members of the Civil Alliance for Student Suicide Prevention protested outside Champion Tower in Central, where Chief Executive-elect Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's office is  located.  They put on blindfolds on which were written "turning a blind eye," criticizing the government for ignoring the problem. Social-welfare sector legislator Shiu Ka-chun said they chose yesterday, Ching Ming Festival and Children's Day, as a memorial to the more than 60 students who have committed suicide since 2015. "They died within Hong Kong's education system and culture of competition and drilling. The government also procrastinated in responding to the issue, and they shifted the blame to the students," he said. The alliance reiterated that the Basic Competency Assessments for Primary Three pupils should be cancelled and urged that a summit to be chaired by the chief secretary be set up to lead interdepartmental work with students, parents, schools and civil groups to examine links between the education system and student suicides. Shiu said the alliance originally planned to meet Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung today but cancelled it after he told them the Legislative Council education panel will discuss the issue on Monday. The alliance also will set up more than 80 streetside booths from tomorrow to collect signatures on pieces of cloth, which will be stitched together to make a quilt. The quilt will be given to Lam once she launches the summit. About 60 of the booths will also be used to explain how harmful resumption of the BCA would be. The spokeswoman of the group's Parents Alliance, Annie Cheung Yim- shuen, denounced Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim for saying the alliance was unprofessional and politicized in opposing the Territory- wide System Assessment. With the booths, she hopes more parents will join their calls to boycott the assessment, adding she fears Lam will not fulfill her election promise to suspend the TSA. "I am 100 percent worried. She is a good fighter, but she may be defeated when facing many people in the establishment," Cheung said. The Education Bureau is studying and following up on the report of the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides submitted in November, according to its online column "Insider's Perspective." Seminars will be held this month for schools and non- governmental organizations to pursue cooperation to enhance students' physical and psychological health, it said. Meanwhile, an Israeli exchange student, 21, was found hanged in her room at Chinese University of Hong Kong International House Monday night. The student, who held a Canadian passport, apparently left a suicide note. Today's Standard

Activist admits mocking Choi after son's death A pro-independence activist has admitted putting up a notice at City University mocking Undersecretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin after she lost her son. It came a day after a notice "congratulated" Choi on her son "going to heaven" was posted at Education University. Choi's eldest son, Peter Poon Hong-  yang, 25, died on Thursday after jumping from the family's flat on the 41st floor of the luxury estate Sorrento in Austin Road West. Poon had been treated for depression after a serious cycling accident while competing in a triathlon. On the day of Poon's death, two men put up a poster at Education University in Tai Po.  Their action was caught by a campus security camera. Footage showing the pair grinning after putting up the poster was leaked to media. It was unclear if they were students of Education University. There was a copycat incident at City University on Friday - and the action was claimed by pro-independence activist Tsoi Pui- keung. Tsoi, 23, dared authorities to "arrest him quickly" after a video surfaced online showing him putting up a notice on a bulletin board that says "congratulations to Christine Choi for the joy of losing her son."  He wrote on his Facebook page yesterday: "I want to know which law I broke."  Tsoi, a former City University student, was arrested last year for threatening Alan Lo Ying-ki, a returning officer of the Registration and Electoral Office, after Hong Kong National Party convener Chan Ho-tin was barred from being nominated to run for the Legislative Council election. Meanwhile, a group of principals warned Education University it will never hire its graduates, a student union leader said. Citing what transpired at a meeting with the university's administrators, Education University of Hong Kong Students' Union president Lala Lai Hiu- ching said on Friday that some principals made the "no hiring" vow. Lai said the university also reported that a number of students had their internships suspended after the incident. Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said the bureau has not been informed of such arrangement but added principals were "concerned" with the situation. Meanwhile, an online petition that claims to have been signed by more than 500 principals and more than 1,000 teachers was sent to Education University on Saturday. Invitations were sent out to teachers via e-mail.  Today's Standard

Frederick Ma, the council chair of the Education University, has urged lawmakers not to put further pressure on students over a recent controversy at the teacher training school. The university recently faced an outcry over malicious slogans posted on its message board. CCTV footage leaked to media showed two men putting up pieces of paper on the campus’s message board “congratulating” Education Undersecretary Choi Yuk-lin for the death of her son. Another slogan mocked the late Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. The identities of those who put up the posters are still unknown. Frederick Ma. Photo: RTHK screenshot. Pro-Beijing lawmaker Ben Chan launched a petition last week urging the school to review its surveillance camera footage and remove them from the school. But in response, Ma urged all sides to stop putting pressure on students. “I ask you all, for the sake of our society, for the sake of our next generation, don’t do this,” he said on a Commercial Radio programme. “Politics is politics, education is education,” he added. Signs saying “Congratulations Choi Yuk-lin on the death of your son” appeared on top of other signs protesting the removal of banners advocating independence on Education University’s Democracy Wall. Photo: Chung Kim Wah/Facebook. He also said that, even if those responsible for the posters were students at the university, their actions did not represent the entire school. “The people trained by this school are mostly teachers. If we get a lot of politics at the university, or [the incident] affects its reputation, it is not good for Hong Kong,” he said. “I do hope this incident will soon pass.” Student Union President Lai Hiu-ching said she heard from top school officials that some schools said they will not employ Education University graduates, and internship opportunities for around ten students had been withdrawn. Education University Vice-Chancellor Stephen Cheung did not give a straight answer when asked whether such incidents had occurred. Vice-chancellor of Education University Stephen Cheung. Photo: RTHK screenshot. He said he hoped the public could give the school some time to handle the situation, whilst it has yet to be confirmed whether the people involved were students at the school. “I hope everyone will not ‘make a judgment before the trial,'” he said. He said the police will not be involved in identifying those involved. He added that if they were the university’s students, they will be protected and given space to give the school an explanation of their actions. “I will respect their identities – we will not reveal them,” he said. A banner mocking Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia. Photo: Screenshot. Cheung said the school did not intentionally leak the footage, and it has asked the privacy commissioner to investigate. Union President Lai said the school has the responsibility to protect personal privacy and she hoped the school will reveal relevant information after the privacy commissioner has completed an investigation.

HK Psychologists Concern has come out in support of the Education Bureau’s “no-suicide contracts” amid debate online. A copy of the contract – which have been made available by the bureau to schools since 2011 – was widely circulated on the internet on Monday night. The document came from an eBook published by the Education Bureau aimed at preventing student suicide. The English version was last updated in October 2015. The professional concern group said that contracts are a “commonly used and effective method” for therapy sessions. “The hope is that through the process of writing the contract, its contents will be highlighted and actualised,” it said. The process of building the contract includes listing out persons to call and methods that are effective in reducing anxiety. It also asks the student to list a person that “cares deeply” about them and “does not want me to harm myself.” No-suicide contract. Photo: Gov HK. The contract could be helpful for students who may be in a confused state, as it would “increase [the] chances of them remembering ways to help themselves when they are tempted to commit suicide,” it added. It urged netizens to stop criticising the contract so that students who seek help will not lose confidence in the contract. However, Cheng Lap, a former teacher, said on Facebook that “this [contract] is being talked about now because society has worsened to such a bad state. What reason do we have to continue to say that this kind of contract, because it is used by social workers, is effective and cannot be criticised? That if there wasn’t such a contract more people would commit suicide?” Photo: Apple Daily. Chow Tsz-yan, a teacher and student guidance officer, told Stand News: “I understand that this tool is not necessarily useful, and there is controversy between [different] schools of thoughts. But according to experience, in cases where a relationship has already been established with the student, it is a fairly effective shield and can function as a gatekeeper.” The psychologists group added that, although it did not think there were problems with the “no-suicide contract,” it said that the eBook published by the Education Bureau was “difficult to understand and messy.” This month, Hong Kong saw seven student suicides in the space of nine days. If you are experiencing negative feelings, please call: The Samaritans 2896 0000 (24-hour, multilingual), Suicide Prevention Centre 2382 0000 or the Social Welfare Department 2343 2255.

No-suicide pledge for youngsters backed A psychologists concern group has backed a no-suicide pledge put forth by the Education Bureau amid online debate that follows the increasingly worrying string of students killing themselves. School social workers and counselors may ask students to sign the contract, according to the updated version of An eBook on Student Suicide for Schools: Early Detection, Intervention & Postvention.  Guidance personnel and social workers  are advised to intervene after identifying at-risk students and mobilize support from concerned parties. They may provide individual counseling using seven tools,  one of which is the no-suicide contract.  The pledge asks the students to promise not to harm themselves and call 999 or 2896-0000 (The Samaritans) immediately if they feel like hurting themselves. It lists other people they may call and  reminds them about "solutions and actions to reduce anxiety and that a loved one would not want them to harm themselves."  Among those who reacted online was Chinese University international relations academic Simon Shen Xu-hui, who said on his Facebook page that the pledge was "unbelievable." He added: "Looks like there will be serious consequences after breaching the contract and arriving in hell." Hours later he said it was just a sarcastic comment. But Hong Kong Psychologists Concern   said the signing of a contract is a proven  method used in counseling. "People would be reminded of the pledge content, and the pledge would make  a troubled student focus on ways to help himself," it said. "The pledge can help a student who is emotionally confused to focus on the simplest ways to help himself, such as finding helpers, calling an assistance hotline and ways to distract his attention from suicide."  The group added: "We call on the public to cease negative discussions of the contract as it could lead to bias, making counselors lose a useful tool." KENNETH LAU Today's Standard

The public broadcaster reported that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. Education Secretary Kevin Yeung said in a statement that he was saddened by the incident and expressed his deepest sympathy to the undersecretary and her family on behalf of the Education Bureau.

Writing's on wall for uni suicide shame The ruckus sparked by a banner congratulating education undersecretary Christine Choi Yuk-lin on the suicide of her 25-year-old son has been going on for a few days now. What's disappointing and unacceptable is Education University of Hong Kong president Stephen Cheung Yan- leung still saying he's clueless as to who put up the tasteless sign. There can only be two possibilities -  either Cheung is highly inefficient, or he's merely trying to protect students. Would he have already told the public if the investigation had concluded the two people filmed putting up the banner were not students of the university? It's quite probable. Even worse, he's now telling us that even if those captured in the video were found to be his students, he wouldn't reveal their identities. Cheung is handling the crisis poorly. If he keeps burying his head in the sand, criticism will continue to come from all directions. Students will keep challenging him, while politicians bombard him. The truth of what's actually happening may be obscure. But the lack of transparency is deepening what's already a crisis. As far as the public can see, it's no longer an incident confined to the university's campus, for public interest is at stake. Unfortunate as it may be, if it is confirmed the culprits are students, Cheung won't be able to blame others for not having confidence in his graduates, of whom many will be teachers, who are expected to tell our youngsters to respect even those they may disagree with. It's about human integrity. Doesn't he realize the image of the new Tai Po university is in danger? Cheung has apparently chosen not to face the issue directly, but rather opting for the easy way out. However, this may well turn out to be a perilous path to take. If somebody has acted wrongly, they should be disciplined. It's as simple as that - which we've been taught ever since we started learning. It's never right to just look the other way and pretend that everything will be hunky-dory. The democracy wall has a long history in local education. As Cheung finished his first degree in Hong Kong, he should know that back in those days, there were administrators for the walls. Students could post their views, but not stealthily. For example, they had to disclose their student numbers to the administrators. Now, the walls are no longer those where students had learned to be responsible for their opinions. Can Cheung dispute this isn't a setback for education? Stop sending the wrong message that misbehavior is acceptable. Remember that learning to be responsible is the basis of education. The students' union warned the university not to unleash white terror by pressing ahead with a witch-hunt. They're wrong, for a witch-hunt involves people who are innocent. If somebody makes a mistake and is punished, that isn't a witch-hunt. Many of the students will be teachers one day, and have to deal with countless incidents of misbehavior day in, day out. Then, what will they do about similar incidents? Please don't tell me they'll also turn a blind eye, and pretend that nothing happened! Today's Standard

The Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK) has urged the public not to view its students as a problematic lot just because some offensive posters made their way onto the so-called democracy wall on the campus. The university is looking into some incidents pertaining to malicious messages on campus posters, EdUHK officials said, adding that they will handle the matter as per established internal procedures.   Appearing on a radio show, university council chairman Frederick Ma Si-hung called on people not to tar the EdUHK student community due to “isolated incidents” on the campus.  In any case, it is not known if the university students were to blame for the vicious posters or some outside persons were behind the incidents, he said. EdUHK pupils are of very high quality and are passionate about their academic work, Ma said, calling on people not to rush to conclusions on the issue of controversial posters. He added that he hopes that society would understand that “politics is politics and education is education”. The comments came as the university was trying to determine the identities of people who had put up “congratulatory” messages last week for the Undersecretary for Education, Christine Choi Yuk-lin, over the suicide of her son. The mocking of the senior government official during a time of personal tragedy has caused shock and outrage among the public, with many people calling for the “culprits” to be expelled from the university. Ma cautioned that one cannot jump to the conclusion that EdUHK students are to blame. In any case, they should be seen as isolated incidents and one should not implicate the entire student community, he said, according to Apple Daily. “I don’t want the education sector to perceive that there are problems with all students at this university,” he said. “For the sake of our next generation, we really should not petition for anything.” The remark came as Legislative Council member Ben Chan Han-pan had pushed for a petition that calls for the tracking down of the student responsible for the offensive messages and expel him or her. Chan said the matter should be treated seriously as it involves a problem of moral standards. Speaking on the same radio show, EdUHK President Professor Stephen Cheung Yan-leung said the university would definitely try to find out who had posted the slogans although they would not call the police. Even if the school has found out who posted the slogan, they would not judge the case before they fully understand the motives and reasons for the student’s actions, he said. Apart from the poster mocking the deputy education chief Choi over her son’s suicide, university authorities were looking into another offensive material that appeared on the democracy wall. In that second poster, someone made light about the death of mainland dissident and Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo. Cheung said the university will not adopt double standard in dealing with the two posters, one of which is suspected to have been put up by a Hong Kong democracy activist and the other by a pro-Beijing individual. The person who had posted the posters about Liu had done so in the middle of the night, with CCTV footage showing someone wearing a big hoodie and a cap. The university immediately notified the Student Union but had not waited for a reply before removing the posters. The student union denounced the malicious messages, but sought to defend the poster activity in the name of freedom of speech, drawing further criticism from others. Following the controversy, university officials were reported to have received emails from some school principals that they wouldn’t hire EdUHK graduates for some time.  Union president Lala Lai Hiu-ching, meanwhile, has demanded that EdUHK apologize for leakage of CCTV footage and lack of protection for the students. The student unions of 13 local universities and tertiary institutions have jointly signed a statement condemning Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor for starting a witch-hunt over campus banners and posters. In the statement they said the posters that appeared in CUHK in relation to Hong Kong independence were not against the law in Hong Kong. They criticized CUHK authorities for taking down the posters, calling it a violation of free speech rights. - Contact us at [email protected] EL/BN/RC 
A student who tore down Hong Kong independence posters at the Chinese University (CUHK) has been praised by Communist Party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. The appearance of signs advocating separatism at several local universities – and some school authorities’ attempts to ban them – has led to controversy and a debate about free speech on campus in recent days. On Tuesday, a video by SocRec showed a student who attempted to take down Hong Kong independence posters being confronted by student union members. It was widely viewed and disseminated online. As a result, the mainland student has been both celebrated and condemned.  In a column focused on Hong Kong in the People’s Daily’s overseas edition, writer Zhang Qingbo supported her act. “In recent days ‘Hong Kong independence’ members have been creating chaos, so some students came out to tear down their posters, and started ‘we refuse to be represented’ actions on social media – these self-motivated acts of justice are worthy of praise and encouragement.” He claimed that unions were not representative of all students, citing declining turnout numbers during elections. He claimed that student unions were linked to pro-independence figures, and were acting as the “pawns” of these figures. “This is why, whenever they do things, there are always students emphasising that ‘the student union does not represent me,'” he said, referring to “CUSU is not CU” posters that appeared on the “Democracy Wall” managed by the student union. ‘Cyber violence’  In an interview with mainland news aggregator Guancha, the student declined to give her name, only revealing that she was from northern China, and saying she was afraid that other students would be able to find her. She said that she became a victim of “cyber violence” on Facebook and received threats. But later on Thursday, she asked the news site to publish a statement from her. She wrote that she felt sad after reading the comments below the posts from Hong Kong media, but after receiving support from Guancha readers, “I know that there is a strong motherland behind me, so no matter what, I should not feel afraid.” Photo: Screenshot/SocRec. She claimed that the posters which were put up were against the rules, and should have been taken down. She added that she was proud of her actions, that she loved CUHK, and asked for privacy so she could concentrate on her studies. The Weibo account of the Communist Youth League also posted in her support on Thursday. Comments beneath the post expressed their support, with some praising the student for her bravery. Many also praised her for her English skills, and denigrated those of the female CUSU representative confronting her. One screenshot of a Weibo comment taken by Guancha said: “Hong Kong separatists are extolling freedom and democracy on one hand, but on the other they are forcibly interfering with other people’s freedom of speech – isn’t this slapping their own mouths? Didn’t think that Hong Kong universities had been reduced to this – give a like to this brave girl.” Below the video posted on Facebook by SocRec, commenters attacked the student, saying she had no right to tear down the posters, and that her actions could constitute criminal damage. Some swore and told her to “go back to China” while others said her English was terrible and that she did not understand democracy. “If you think they don’t have any right to put thing on the wall, so why did you think you have the right to tears [sic] off something? Are you fucking idiots or just a bitch!” one comment that received over a hundred likes said.  Comments

The death of a Sichuan student who appeared to have fallen to his death from his dorm building has sparked widespread public anger in China, causing netizens, local residents and even official media to demand answers from local authorities. A 14-year-old student surnamed Zhao was found dead on the ground outside a building at Taifu Middle School on Saturday. The local police issued a statement on Sunday saying that Zhao’s injuries seemed to be caused by a fall from height, and that they had evidence ruling out the possibility that his death was caused by others. Zhao and his mother; Zhao’s body where it was found. Photos: Weibo. Rumours spread online after Zhao’s death, with some claiming he was bullied and killed by five classmates, and that his body was covered with bruises, with his arms and legs broken. They said his grandparents reported the bullying to the police, but the police did not act on the phone call. Some rumours also claimed that the classmates who bullied Zhao included the children of powerful local figures. The local government announced on Monday that it had arrested four people for allegedly spreading rumours about Zhao’s death through QQ chat groups, WeChat official accounts and other online avenues. Protests Despite efforts to halt rumours, Weibo users, local citizens and official media outlets continued to criticise the local authorities for their handling of the case and the questions that remained unanswered. According to US-backed Radio Free Asia, hundreds of people had been gathering in front of the school for several days since Saturday in protest of the way the matter was being handled. State tabloid the Global Times also reported that hundreds took to the streets in protest after Zhao’s death. One local resident told RFA on Wednesday that the crowds had thinned out following efforts by the police, but that there were still at least one to two hundred people at the school, along with a heavy police presence.

Criticism Xinhua, China’s official news agency, raised questions about Zhao’s death on Thursday morning in a sharp critique of local authorities’ handling of the incident. “According to the notice, if the authorities have already determined whether the child committed suicide or was killed by others before the autopsy results have come out, then what is the point of conducting an autopsy?” it said. The agency reported that, in a video clip seen by its reporter, the child’s mother cut open his shirt in the funeral parlour to find huge bruises on his back and injuries on his hands and elbows. It also said that his parents had not consented to the police conducting an autopsy, contrary to a statement from local police. When Xinhua’s reporter asked two local officials what evidence they had that eliminated the possibility of murder or manslaughter by others, and whether Zhao was bullied, they were told that they were online rumours and that they did not have to respond according to the law. Social media outcry The topic of Zhao’s death on social media site Weibo has been read by over two billion people, with over 140,000 users commenting on the matter. Many have called on the authorities to tell the truth. Some compared the case to a recent sentencing that sparked public outcry against the police, when a young man who was given a life sentence in February for killing a debtor who sexually assaulted his mother in front of him. Police were called but did not intervene, according to an initial court verdict. The country’s top prosecutor said it will review the case following the public backlash. Taifu Middle School, Sichuan. One verified Weibo user – Zhao Jian, the director of a law firm in Beijing – posted about the incident, saying: “We need the truth! ‘The authorities’ and ‘the internet’, which version is ‘authoritative’ and which is ‘rumour’? The word ‘trust’ is powerful and fragile – if trust collapses, this will become a frightening world.” Another user cited by Xinhua’s report said: “Falling from a height is only the cause of death – when did it become evidence eliminating the possibility that it was done by someone else? Isn’t there a possibility that the fall was caused by another person? If the deceased committed suicide then where is the suicide note? If there was school violence then were the bullies questioned? How can the police settle public anger if they make such a perfunctory judgement?”  Comments

A poster mocking the death of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has appeared on the campus of the Education University, two days after a similar poster mocking the death of a local official’s son was widely condemned and removed. Written in simplified Chinese, the apparently satirical poster on the Democracy Wall read: “Congratulations to Liu Bandit Xiaobo on going west, congratulations to [his wife] Liu Xia on being forever house-imprisoned by our party.” The banner mocking Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia. Photo: Screenshot. The Education University said on Saturday morning that it strongly condemned the poster, and has removed it in accordance with policy owing to its offensive nature. Poster row The row over posters began after banners supporting Hong Kong independence were displayed and then taken down at the Chinese University of Hong Kong earlier in the week. Competing messages soon began appearing on the symbolic Democracy Wall with those who supported, and those who opposed, independence vying for space. Arguments then broke out between Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking students.

That evening, Education University vice-chancellor Stephen Cheung told TVB that he would investigate CCTV footage to determine whether the perpetrators were students or outsiders. “If they were outsiders, we we’ll put them online to tell everyone that it’s these two men who did such shocking things,” he added.

The student union of Education University released a statement that evening condemning the leak of the screenshots to the media. “[The school] has brought hot-headed Cultural Revolution-style public criticisms – so prevalent in Hong Kong in recent years – onto campus,” it read. Different attitudes Student union President Lai Hiu-ching said the Liu Xiaobo poster was of similar wording to the poster on Choi’s son, but the school had adopted different attitudes for the two incidents. Vice-chancellor Stephen Cheung did not specifically hold a press conference in person to condemn the Liu Xiaobo poster, unlike when handling the poster on Choi’s son. Lai said it would make the public consider whether the different attitudes were because of the different political backgrounds of the incidents. “Clearly the levels of condemnation were different,” she said. Lai also said she heard from top school officials at a meeting on the incidents that some schools had said they will not employ Education University graduates, and internship opportunities for around ten students were cancelled. Lai said such actions would seriously affect students and she hoped the public should not make condemnations before the identities of people who pasted the posters were confirmed. “Even if the posters were pasted up by Education University students, what does it have to do with other students?” she said. Education secretary Kevin Yeung said he has not heard such news. Photo: Apple Daily. The three people later stopped by security staffers, who suspected the person was not a student. They called the police, but no arrests have been made.  Comments

Zhang, who was the director of the commission’s general political department, was investigated in connection to Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, top military officials who were expelled from the ruling Communist Party. Guo, a vice-chairman of the commission, became the most senior People’s Liberation Army (PLA) official to be convicted of corruption in half of century when he was sentenced to life in 2016. Xu, also a vice-chairman, died of cancer in 2015 while undergoing a probe for graft.

On January 24, Ronald Chin, president of the Hong Kong Baptist University, announced the suspension of two BU students who, on January 17, went with other students to the Language Centre to protest against the unfairness of the University’s requirement that students to pass a Putonghua exam as a graduation prerequisite. Chin alleged that the two students had threatened teachers at the centre physically and verbally but – as can be seen from the video record – only one student uttered a Cantonese word meaning “dick”, and no students used any violence.  Cantonese, the mother tongue of most Hongkongers and one of the de facto official oral languages of Hong Kong (the other one being English), is a 3,000-year-old elegant language, still spoken by 100 million people. Putonghua, the official language of China, has a history of at the most 300-400 years. Many Hongkongers think that it is discriminatory to require Hong Kong college students to pass a Putonghua exam as a prerequisite to graduate, while Mainland students studying in Hong Kong are not required to take any course or exam in Cantonese. Quite a few Hong Kong netizens regard this policy as promotion of Chinese colonisation, in view of the fact that Tibetans and Uygurs are forbidden to speak or write their mother language at schools in China. Students whose mother tongue is not Chinese or who have taken Chinese exams in China are exempted from the university’s language requirement. Last year, the school put forth a Putonghua exemption exam for local students too. But the pass rate was only 30 percent. The students attribute this to the assessment standard being unclear. On January 17, a few students, including Lau Chi-kei, chair of the HKBU Student Union, and Chan Lok-hang, a final year Chinese medicine student, went to the Language Centre of the Baptist University to ask the staff to explain how they assessed the students’ Putonghua and to produce the rubrics concerned. But staff refused to respond. And despite the students’ repeated requests, more senior staff at the university refused to talk to the students. The situation dragged on for eight hours. Then, Lau Chi-kei uttered the Cantonese word, lan2卵, which means dick – literally, in the following sentence: “You said you wouldn’t the dick respond – wouldn’t respond to the students’ demands.” But as can be seen from the video, none of the students present at the scene uttered any other swearwords. Nor did they use any physical violence. They did not even make any threatening gestures, although one expatriate teacher at the scene claimed that they were being threatened by the students. Many netizens commented that – when encountering a gross injustice – it is only a normal human reaction to utter a swear word or two. Standoff between students and university staff. Photo: BUSU, via Facebook. On January 24, Lau Chi-kei and Chan Lok-hang publicly apologised for their behaviour at the protest. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the same day, the president of Baptist University announced temporary suspensions for both students for having breached the code of conduct by orally insulting and physically threatening teaching staff of the university. Subsequently, at a press conference held on the same day, Lau and Chan stressed that – on January 17 – they only aimed at reforming the university administration and did not use any violence. They condemned the HKBU president for confounding right and wrong, for paying no heed to students’ studies and safety. It turns out that in recent days, when Chan Lok-hang was studying as an HKBU intern in Canton, he received more than 100 death threats from China netizens. He tried to seek help from the university via a district councillor, Clarisse Yeung. But the president of the school did not any offer help until Lau fled back to Hong Kong on the morning of January 24. Plus, the president has never sent any other word of comfort or reassurance to Chan. Lau and Chan said: “We are now forced to take a path of no return; from now on, we will struggle for students’ rights and welfare without care!” The languages that should be grasped as one of the requirements of graduation are written Chinese and English. Oral languages do not need to be assessed. Even if students’ oral speech is to be assessed, it should only be Cantonese and English. For Cantonese is the mother tongue of most Hongkongers and university students. According to the Basic Law, the official languages of Hong Kong are Chinese and English, but it is not specified whether “Chinese” means Cantonese or Putonghua as far as oral speech is concerned. Nonetheless, for 170 years, Cantonese and English have been the de facto official spoken languages of Hong Kong. Since 1842, in all official situations in Hong Kong, including courts, government departments, Executive and Legislative Councils, schools, mass media, etc., either Cantonese or English are spoken.

Various student bodies, including the HKBU Student Union, Student Christian Movement of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Federation of Students, protested in support of the two suspended students and demanded the University cancel the Putonghua exam or test. Hong Kong Cantonese is a tripartite compound language comprising the Pak Yuet languages, classical Chinese, and loan words from the West. Pak Yuet is a group of ancient minorities living in Southern China, closely related to Vietnamese and Thai. Still spoken by more than 100 million people all over the world, Cantonese can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period around 3,000 years ago. It is a reservoir of elegant and orthodox Chinese culture and language. Instead of suppressing the Cantonese language in Hong Kong, the British colonial government of Hong Kong used to preserve and promote it. File photo: Anthony Wallace/AFP. Contrastingly, Putonghua is an artificial language imposed by the Chinese Communist Party on Mainland Chinese. Due to the mandatory state policy of using Putonghua as the teaching medium at school, Cantonese on the Chinese Mainland has been deteriorating. In recent years, the Education Bureau of the Hong Kong government, which is largely appointed by China, has been using financial subsidies to lure schools in Hong Kong into teaching the Chinese subject in Putonghua instead of Cantonese. Hong Kong should do more to preserve this time-honoured and elegant language.

My heart just aches whenever I hear news of students taking their own lives. According to the third report published earlier this year by the Review Panel of the Pilot Project on Child Fatality Review, between 2012 and 2013, a total of 206 child deaths were reported to the Coroner’s Court. And among the 75 deaths by unnatural causes, 20 of them were caused by suicides, with the youngest victim aged only 11. Among these 20 suicide cases, 14 victims had shown suicidal signs such as emotional volatility and violent behavior before they ended their own lives. The report concluded that many of these victims could actually have been prevented from killing themselves if their teachers or parents had been able to recognize their emotional problems sooner and seek professional help immediately. In fact, I cannot agree more with the conclusion of the report. I believe the key to preventing child and teen suicides is early detection and immediate intervention. And both teachers and parents can indeed play an important role in preventing tragedy by constantly monitoring the psychological state of their students and children, particularly during the first few weeks of the new school year and seeking immediate help from psychiatric professionals if need be. In the meantime, the government must devise solid plans and divert extra resources to support our schools and parents in their fight against student suicides. For example, over the years I have been calling upon the government to implement the so-called one-school-one-nurse policy in our schools, under which there would be at least one registered psychiatric nurse (RPN) stationed in every primary and secondary school across our city. The RPN in our schools would assume a leading role in identifying high-risk cases and providing professional assessment and support. And if necessary, the RPN can also refer students who need help to public mental health clinics run by the Hospital Authority (HA). Once teachers or parents have noticed any warning sign of suicide among students, they can immediately refer the case to the RPN in their schools, who can then intervene with them as soon as possible and provide proper and timely help before tragedy strikes. On the other hand, the RPN can also offer teachers and parents professional advice on how to meet the emotional needs of students and how to guide those who are struggling with emotional problems or stress-related depression. I learned that the Food and Health Bureau, the Education Bureau as well as the Social Welfare Department jointly launched the Student Mental Health Support Pilot Scheme last year, under which the HA sent two RPNs to each of the nine local schools that volunteered to take part in the scheme. And in April this year, the government further enhanced the scheme by sending an extra two senior RPNs to seven secondary and one primary schools. I welcome the government initiatives, but I also feel compelled to emphasize that in order to make sure the scheme will remain effective, viable and sustainable, the government must divert more manpower and resources into supporting it. On the other hand, since the introduction of the HKDSE (Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education), the average age of university freshmen in our city has dropped, calling into question their ability to manage study-related stress. I suggest that the one-school-one-nurse policy be extended to our tertiary institutions as well, under which university students can seek help from the RPNs directly through smartphone apps and social media. Apart from offering help and therapy, the government should also provide sufficient support for teachers and parents and equip them with the necessary know-how so that they can promote a positive outlook on life among our teenagers and help them build resilience.

Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen said potential cash handouts to students should be of differing amounts, catered to different needs, rather than a fixed sum for all. The government is expected to report a surplus of more than HK$140 billion in Wednesday’s annual budget. Several media outlets including Now TV and i-Cable cited sources as saying that the government was not inclined to conduct cash handouts, but will give HK$2,000 to grassroots students who qualify for student subsidies and tuition remission schemes. Around 220,000 students from kindergarten up to university level could benefit. The scheme will cost around HK$600 million with handouts beginning at the start of the next academic year in September. Ip Kin-yuen. File Photo: In-Media. Ip said on a Commercial Radio programme on Tuesday that there are practical advantages in giving cash to grassroots students: “But it may be relatively small candy.” He said students at different levels have different needs: “University students may need to pay for internet and they may dine out more, their needs may be bigger.” “Primary school or kindergarten students who may not go out a lot have a different situation. It is an interesting question as to how the amount of HK$2,000 came up.” He also suggested the government could help purchase digital tablets and subside internet fees for grassroots children, as well as increase funds for university research, better facilities and improved teacher training. Financial Secretary Paul Chan. Photo: GovHK. He said it was a good initiative but the scheme may not be in line with public expectations. “People are thinking that we have such a large surplus, maybe we can make a bigger move such as a universal pension scheme,” he said. “The middle class may expect tax and land rate rebates. Compared with these expectations, I believe HK$2,000 is relatively small.” In 2011, then-financial secretary John Tsang launched a scheme whereby permanent residents aged over 18 could receive a one-off HK$6,000 payment. The plan was devised following criticism of his original proposal which involved injecting the sum into Hongkonger’s Mandatory Provident Fund pension accounts. The programme – which was not means tested – cost around HK$36 billion. Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote in a blog post on Sunday that the government has to use public resources reasonably and prepare for the future, amid rumours of cash handouts. For instance, he said resources should be spent on improving healthcare when there is a large surplus.
