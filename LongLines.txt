Apparently since the Diploma of Secondary Education came into full flowering in 2012 about 71 students in the relevant age group have eluded the examiners by killing themselves.
It is always difficult to be sure of the motives of people who commit suicide
There is a tendency for one reported case to inspire imitation.
Even so, I remember the days when a toll of one or two suicides in an examination season was considered bad news.
A protest against student suicides.
The only other indicator of any interest is the student's choice.
Drawing attention to two recent attempts at suicide (both, fortunately, half-hearted and unsuccessful) and wondering if exam stress could be reduced as this seemed to be a cause.
We discussed the matter further and agreed that a student counselling service was a good idea.
As I was the student union president at the time this proposal was sure of a favourable wind from several directions and materialised rather quickly.

The unlikely reform which I think would help is giving more thought to the idea that the entire student population should take the same exam.

Three letters that strike fear into every Hong Kong student and cause debilitating anxiety.
With this year's exams starting, we need to raise awareness of the tremendous pressure Hong Kong students are under and be mindful of its dangers.
the public examination students take in the final year of secondary school – is among the most high-pressure exams in the world.
The DSE has a relatively low coursework element and less flexibility – compared with the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the AS and A2 Level exams in the UK – so the fate of students comes down to the final two weeks of exams rather than the pressure being spread throughout the year.
university entry requirements in Hong Kong are almost solely DSE-based
drawing a straight connection between the DSE and future employability that cranks up the pressure on students even further.
With the DSE as the only gateway to these vital qualifications, the pressure is enormous.
Since 2013, the second year of the DSE, about 71 students have committed suicide.
For students, there are immense stress levels and various forms of mental illness.
During the last months of secondary school, work piles up, extra lessons and tutor classes take up all free time and expectations from various angles suffocate the students.
tutors like Billy Ng expect students to deal with it all, saying things like: 'Young people just have to get over the pressure.
One student from this year's cohort described the pressure they are under as 'so overwhelming that I was unable to catch my breath.
A protest raising awareness of student suicides.
A former DSE student myself, I remember those final exams as the worst time of my life.
I am not a social person by nature, but due to the pressure of the DSE I essentially became mute.
After finishing the DSE, I thought I had recovered from the ordeal but even now in times of high pressure my body can revert to the intense fight or flight mode created by the DSE and the negative symptoms can reappear.
The intense stress of the DSE period has a potentially traumatic effect that can remain with students long after the event.
In the long term, changes must be made in universities' entry requirements and in the DSE system itself to ease the pressure on students.
In the meantime, we may have to settle for raising awareness of the pressures involved in this uniquely traumatic exam, and paying careful attention to those going through the process in the next two months.

The alliance, which represents student guidance teachers, said its members had been told by the Education Bureau that teachers should go back to their posts so their counseling function can be taken up by social workers.
Ho said about 20 percent of primary schools in Hong Kong have student guidance teachers, which means a total of 120.
Besides counseling, counseling teachers are also responsible for coordinating different departments to arrange activities for students.
They also offer student support and life education, while also handling their cases.
"Our advantages are we are stable in schools, and we have the chance to learn every student's needs," Ho said.
Anthony Wong Kin-wai, business director at the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, said suicides among students has been a serious issue in recent years.
Lau, chairman of Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd., considers it more realistic for the YDC to focus on preventing students from committing suicide than dealing with political issues such as self-determination.

Leung also said teachers and staff of the school would check with the students and parents on finding any suspicious injuries on children.
Social welfare sector lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun has hit out at Chief Executive Carrie Lam for neglecting to mention the problem of student suicides in her policy address.
During a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Council on Thursday, Shiu told Lam that there were two instances of suicide and attempted suicide earlier that day.
A CUHK student was taken to the hospital around 2am after a suspected suicide attempt, and an 11-year-old boy in school uniform died after falling from a building in Tai Po, according to Ming Pao and RTHK.
Over the past two years, there have been over 72 suicides among young people, from primary school students to postgraduate students.
Under what circumstances will you properly and solemnly respond to the problem of youth suicides, and host a summit on youth suicides?
In response, Lam said that there was 'no need to use such emotional language,' and added that she started being concerned about youth suicides when she was the Director of Social Welfare.

Earlier this year, concern groups petitioned Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, urging him to hold a summit on youth suicides.
Her policy address did not mention student suicides specifically, but it said: 'Based on the evaluation results of the Student Mental Health Support Pilot Scheme, we will consider ways to provide appropriate support services for students with mental health needs.
