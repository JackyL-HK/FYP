Apparently since the Diploma of Secondary Education came into full flowering in 2012 about 71 students in the relevant age group have eluded the examiners by killing themselves.
It is always difficult to be sure of the motives of people who commit suicide, and there is a tendency for one reported case to inspire imitation.
Even so, I remember the days when a toll of one or two suicides in an examination season was considered bad news.
A protest against student suicides.
When four-year degrees arrived, the committee of university heads decided (this was not a necessary feature of the new system) to abandon the old arrangement by which a course selected its own students.
The only other indicator of any interest is the student's choice.
An oddity I noticed on arrival was that all student rooms had brand new electric fires.
This was because the university had decreed, after a spate of student suicides using gas, that all gas fires should be replaced with something less obviously lethal.
They would admit about 20 per cent more students to the first year than they had places for in the laboratory subjects which started in the second.
One of my first attempts at journalism was a column in a student publication at the University of Lancaster drawing attention to two recent attempts at suicide (both, fortunately, half-hearted and unsuccessful) and wondering if exam stress could be reduced as this seemed to be a cause.
We discussed the matter further and agreed that a student counselling service was a good idea.
As I was the student union president at the time this proposal was sure of a favourable wind from several directions and materialised rather quickly.
It seems also that while the student whose continuous assessment is successful can comfort himself with the thought that he enters the exam room with some money in the bank, as it were, the student who is less successful in term time may find the exam an even more onerous and frightening ordeal than if he was allowed to start from scratch.

The unlikely reform which I think would help is giving more thought to the idea that the entire student population should take the same exam.

Three letters that strike fear into every Hong Kong student and cause debilitating anxiety.
With this year's exams starting, we need to raise awareness of the tremendous pressure Hong Kong students are under and be mindful of its dangers.
the public examination students take in the final year of secondary school – is among the most high-pressure exams in the world.
The DSE has a relatively low coursework element and less flexibility – compared with the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the AS and A2 Level exams in the UK – so the fate of students comes down to the final two weeks of exams rather than the pressure being spread throughout the year.
Furthermore, university entry requirements in Hong Kong are almost solely DSE-based, drawing a straight connection between the DSE and future employability that cranks up the pressure on students even further.
With the DSE as the only gateway to these vital qualifications, the pressure is enormous.
Since 2013, the second year of the DSE, about 71 students have committed suicide.
For students, there are immense stress levels and various forms of mental illness.
During the last months of secondary school, work piles up, extra lessons and tutor classes take up all free time and expectations from various angles suffocate the students.
At the same time, tutors like Billy Ng expect students to deal with it all, saying things like: 'Young people just have to get over the pressure.
One student from this year's cohort described the pressure they are under as 'so overwhelming that I was unable to catch my breath.
A protest raising awareness of student suicides.
A former DSE student myself, I remember those final exams as the worst time of my life.
I am not a social person by nature, but due to the pressure of the DSE I essentially became mute.
After finishing the DSE, I thought I had recovered from the ordeal but even now in times of high pressure my body can revert to the intense fight or flight mode created by the DSE and the negative symptoms can reappear.
The intense stress of the DSE period has a potentially traumatic effect that can remain with students long after the event.
In the long term, changes must be made in universities' entry requirements and in the DSE system itself to ease the pressure on students.
In the meantime, we may have to settle for raising awareness of the pressures involved in this uniquely traumatic exam, and paying careful attention to those going through the process in the next two months.

The body of the victim, Poon Hiu-wing, 20, a student at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education, was found in a plastic bag that was dumped in a grassy area near the Taipei Metro Zhuwei station by Taiwan police, Apple Daily reports.

Social welfare sector lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun has hit out at Chief Executive Carrie Lam for neglecting to mention the problem of student suicides in her policy address.
During a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Council on Thursday, Shiu told Lam that there were two instances of suicide and attempted suicide earlier that day.
A CUHK student was taken to the hospital around 2am after a suspected suicide attempt, and an 11-year-old boy in school uniform died after falling from a building in Tai Po, according to Ming Pao and RTHK.
Over the past two years, there have been over 72 suicides among young people, from primary school students to postgraduate students.
Under what circumstances will you properly and solemnly respond to the problem of youth suicides, and host a summit on youth suicides?
In response, Lam said that there was 'no need to use such emotional language,' and added that she started being concerned about youth suicides when she was the Director of Social Welfare.
If you ask Professor Paul Yip, who has done the most research on suicides in Hong Kong, I have long demonstrated concern over the issue and in order to facilitate his research, I have requested that departments make numbers available to him.
Shiu Ka-chun holding a list of dates on which students committed suicide.
Earlier this year, concern groups petitioned Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, urging him to hold a summit on youth suicides.
Her policy address did not mention student suicides specifically, but it said: 'Based on the evaluation results of the Student Mental Health Support Pilot Scheme, we will consider ways to provide appropriate support services for students with mental health needs.

More than 100 people took part in a barefoot march on Sunday in Hong Kong, calling on the government to pay more attention to the issue of student suicides.
The rally, led by members from two concern groups — the Civil Alliance for Student Suicide Prevention, and Parents United of Hong Kong
During the event, protesters demanded that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor take the youth suicide problem seriously and carry out changes in the education system, Apple Daily reports.
The march came amid mounting concerns among parents, teachers and social workers after Hong Kong witnessed 74 student suicides in the city between August 2015 and October 12 this year.
During the rally Sunday, protestors took off their shoes and placed them on a black banner on the floor, with all 74 suicide dates marked out on the banner in order to remind the public of the tragic incidents.
By visualizing the suicide cases in such a way, the group said it hoped to raise awareness in society about the problem.
After the demonstration was over, the protestors all bowed down in silence as the dates of the students' suicides were recited.
Both the organizations backed Legislator Shiu Ka-chun's idea that the government should launch a summit to handle student suicide problems, news website
The idea was rejected by Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Law Chi-kwong, with the official arguing that a high-profile summit would only 'spread the infectious idea of suicide'.
The concern groups responded by stating that the summit would not tackle each suicide case individually, but will only discuss ways to improve the entire system as a whole.
Yam said he joined Sunday's protest because he believes the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education examination is causing too much stress for students.
Yam told Apple Daily that each time a student commits suicide, he feels as if he himself had been the executioner as he had been teaching them and giving them homework.
As the Hong Kong education system puts too much stress on results, many schools had pushed their students too hard and made matters worse.
The government is under pressure to take measures after three student suicide cases were reported in one day on Thursday.
One of the victims, an 18-year-old secondary 6 student, was saved by passers-by after he jumped into the river from a pedestrian overpass near the Tai Po Mega Mall, Apple Daily reports.
A source said pressure from schoolwork drove him to try to kill himself.
A secondary six student also died in hospital after he jumped off the top of the Domain Mall in Yau Tong at about 11:21 a.m.
Police recovered a note at the scene, in which the 17-year-old said he was under pressure and felt he had no direction in life.
Social welfare functional constituency lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun and the Civil Alliance for Student Suicide Prevention urged the government to take action to prevent a recurrence of the incidents.
They proposed a government-led anti-teenage suicide summit to help tackle the problem.
More than 20 students have committed suicide so far this year, according to Apple Daily.

No let up in student suicide battle Schools are better prepared to prevent student suicides this year, but more needs to be done through social media, an expert says.
"Apart from talking about classes, the schools also tell students to seek help if they have problems," said Paul Yip Siu- fai, the head of the Education Bureau's Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides.
Yip, director of the University of Hong Kong's Center for Suicide Research and Prevention, was appointed last year to head the panel following a spate of student suicides.
Yip said the committee is discussing with social-media giants, including Facebook and Google, about procedures for handling signs of potential suicides on the internet and how to find those students as quickly as possible.
He said students express such signs in many ways.
Yip said the authorities also helped teachers to improve their ability to detect students who have problems, and to put more resources in the education sector.
He also appreciated the positive changes in media reports, saying there were fewer sensational reports about students committing suicide in the past six months.
The Social Welfare Department's Child Fatality Review Panel released its third report on Thursday, saying there were 20 child or youth suicide cases among 206 deaths of children aged below 18 in 2012 and 2013 reported to the Coroner's Court, including those who died of natural and non- natural causes.
It also said children and youngsters committing suicide were mainly due to "schoolwork problems, worries about their futures and relationship problems with family members or boyfriends or girlfriends."
Yip quoted the report as saying about 70 percent of children who committed suicide showed suicidal signs but adults sometimes ignored those signals because they were too busy.
Liu also said students face much greater pressure than previous generations.
Citing an official report released last week on child fatality, Professor Paul Yip Siu-fai, who chairs the committee, said on Sunday that about 70 per cent of young Hongkongers who committed suicide had shown warning signs in different ways.
Facebook has introduced a suicide prevention tool enabling users to flag posts from friends who show warning signs.
Google has been featuring search results about suicide prevention help and tips more prominently when users look for particular combinations such as 'ways to commit suicide'.
The committee was set up last year after a worrying spike in the number of youth suicides in the city.
Dr Liu Kwong-sun, deputy director of the Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, said many clinical cases showed suicidal intentions existed among pupils in local, direct-subsidy and international schools, students at universities and even adults who had just left the education system and started work.
This shows that the society-wide expectation of students is very high, much higher than what students can afford,' Liu said on a radio show on Sunday.
We did not have this environmental pressure in the last generation.

22-year-old student falls to death  A university student who fell from a height in Kowloon Tong today has died.
The young man was a fourth-year Hong Kong Baptist University student, who studied social sciences, Headline Daily reported.
Some of the money is for poor students, some is for talented students whom I want to encourage, including foreign students who want to study in China,' Yu said before his death.
After the decision on Tuesday, Coroner Ko Wai-hung told family members of the 17-year-old student not to blame themselves but to find strength to continue living as the accident no doubt has had a great impact on them.
The student was found lying on the ground in front of a building on the school campus on Aug. 5 last year.
The student's mother told the court on Tuesday that her son had never shown any inclination to harm himself.

There has been a rise in student suicides in the city in recent years.
More than 60 youngsters took their lives between September 2015 and April this year, or an average of three students each month.
And a vicious circle seems to be happening; more suicides 'goad
' more disgruntled students to take the same path.
Parents, and society as a whole, need to do some soul-searching as to what factors are pushing our students off the edge – heavy loads of schoolwork, anxiety over academic records, disputes with family members, relationship problems with boyfriend/girlfriend, etc.
A student who grows up in a happy family is unlikely to commit suicide.
Parents and other family members are the first and last ones that a student with suicidal issues can count on.
This may add up to their feeling of estrangement, which may lead them to consider suicide as an option.
A lesson from many rueful parents is that some students may try to keep their stress under wraps even when they have long been feeling despondent or even thinking of ending their lives.
Spur-of-the-moment suicides are exceptionally rare, as they are against human nature and instinct for survival.
It may take up to 90 days, with multiple phases, from thinking of suicide to actually committing it.
Parents must ask themselves: Does suicide really occur without any indication, or is it just that parents fail, or are too busy, to take note of them?
To students: Why you'll miss your schooldays like we do 
Education University (EdUHK) and the Education Bureau have condemned messages that 'congratulated' a government official's son after his death.
The university's student union issued a statement saying that it was not responsible for the signs, and that it had sent representatives to take them down.
We have still not been able to confirm if the involved party is a student of the university.
In any case, it is clear that if a student is punished by school authorities as a result of a morally controversial statement, it will lead students in the future to be scared of expressing their views, self-censoring, and creating white terror on campus,' said the statement.
The union said that the university should respect the autonomy of the student union in managing the Democracy Wall.

The Hong Kong Jockey Club and City University of Hong Kong interviewed 464 Secondary One students from four schools and 449 Primary Five and Six students from two schools last September and October.
Applied social sciences associate professor Kwok Lai Yuk-ching noted that Secondary One students face an especially high suicide risk. "
As secondary One students need to adapt to many changes, including a new learning environment, social circle and physical changes during puberty, they are more likely to be emotionally stressed and develop a suicidal wish," Kwok said.
The survey also showed that if students feel hopeless and perceive themselves as a burden to others, they are at higher risk of suicide.
She even told me she wanted to commit suicide when she was in Primary One because she could not adapt to the huge pressure from dictation and examinations," said Chow, who joined the workshop of a project run by the Jockey Club-funded Suicide Prevention Services in the spring.
Suicide Prevention Services executive director Vincent Ng Chi-kwan warned that now is a high-risk period for students' emotional and suicidal problems as the final exams are approaching and the public examination result will be released soon. "
He was the fifth to die in six attempted suicides by Hong Kong students within 17 days.
His suicide may be linked to a scolding by his parents for spending too much time on computer games the night before, local media reported.
The school said in a statement that its teachers and students were devastated by the news.

The student was an enthusiast in rooftopping, a practice of taking photographs at the top of skyscrapers.

Call to limit student study hours Concern groups proposed the setting of "standard studying hours" to reduce student stress and help to prevent suicides.
Youngsters face enormous pressure under the current education system as apart from attending school, many also go to tutorial classes.
Extended study time leads to insufficient sleep and play, said the groups  Social Workers Align With Students Under Pressure and Citizens' Alliance for Prevention of Youth Suicide.
On World Suicide Prevention Day yesterday, the groups urged the government to face up to the problem of students taking their own lives and consider setting regulations or guidelines to restrict the number of study hours - similar to standard working hours for employees.
Over the past two months, the groups interviewed 631 students, parents, teachers and social workers, and some 90 percent supported the idea of standard studying hours.
Lai Pak-yin, spokesman for Social Workers Align With Students Under Pressure, said many secondary school students spend around 10 hours on their studies every day, with some even taking longer than that.
He also said government suggestions for tackling student suicides are not practical for frontline teachers and social workers - it is more important to stay with students when they are going through a hard time than training them to have a positive attitude.
Chan Chi-chung from Citizens' Alliance for Prevention of Youth Suicide said there should be fundamental changes in the education system, as academic studies are the main source of pressure for students.
Cheung said studying seven hours a day is already a long time, and many students do not get eight hours of sleep.
The groups are continuing the survey until next month to gather views on ways to reduce students' pressure.
They also urged the government to hold a student suicide prevention summit to listen to opinions from society.
A 17-year-old Secondary Six student plunged to his death from a school building in Tin Shui Wai.
The victim was found on the ground in front of the school building by students gathering for a morning assembly.
The case has been listed as suicide, pending further investigation.
About 20 students are in need of emotional counseling, it said.
He said students should try to turn pressure to motivation by clarifying the goal of study and finding ways to ease it, such as by sharing their feelings with friends, doing certain activities and seeking professional help.
Tsang Chin-kwok, director of the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong, a suicide prevention organization, urged parents to pay more attention to their children's emotional changes, especially if they appear too quiet, spiritless or confused.

On Sunday at around 9am, a 16-year-old male secondary school student took his own life at Lee On Estate, a public housing estate in Ma On Shan.
The following day at around 6am, a 13-year-old female secondary school student took her own life at Cheung Ching Estate, a public housing estate in Tsing Yi.
The bureau also referred to the final report of the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides, published last November, which said that suicides were caused by multiple complicated interacting factors.
The committee had been established by the Education Bureau in March 2016 following a spate of student suicides.
On Monday, lawmaker Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu published an email he received from a form three secondary school student, criticising the Education Bureau chief Eddie Ng Hak-kim for claiming last October that student suicides could be prevented by better life planning.
The student said that he was stressed over academic results because of the education system:
Like most of Hong Kong's students, I can't see any future.
35 cases of student suicide were reported last year.

Two student suicides lead to alert for schools and parents Two secondary students have taken their own lives in the past two days, prompting another call for the government to review the education system.
A suicide note was found and it is believed the girl was troubled by academic issues.
Suicide Prevention Services executive director Vincent Ng Chi-kwan said his group's hotlines receive more than 3,000 calls a month on average, with about 500 from people aged 24 or below.
Most of the young users who were emotionally troubled or even suicidal reflected pressure from school work and family issues.
Last year, Hong Kong saw a spate of student suicides, prompting the government to appoint the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides.
Ip again expressed disappointment with the committee report, which concluded that "there is no direct correlation between student suicide cases and the overall education system."
He called upon the government to review the education system by canceling unnecessary assessments that burden pupils and looking into the student-teacher ratio.
Calls for a review of the education system are growing after the back-to-back suicides of two young students soon after the Lunar New Year holidays.
Her death came just one day after a young student plunged to his death in Lee On Estate in Ma On Shan.
The Education Bureau cited findings by an investigation committee that student suicides are often caused by 'multiple complex reasons' that influnce one another, Apple Daily reported.
Ng Wai-han, a senior social worker at YWCA, said many young people face pressures from schoolwork and interpersonal relationships, and they are especially vulnerable to post-holiday depression.
Meanwhile, Civic Party lawmaker Alvin Yeung posted to Facebook a letter sent to him by a Secondary Three student who complained that many of his peers can't see the future since all they do every day is learn without really understanding.

By Kelvin Lee Recent suicide cases among primary and secondary students have drawn fresh scrutiny to Hong Kong's education system.
Parent groups pressed for the removal of Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA), a standardized test aimed at evaluating school performance, dubbing the exam a major source of stress and anxiety among students.
TSA/BCA currently evaluates school performance by measuring student academic proficiency.
Much like any other public examination in Hong Kong, this means looking at the absolute score a student achieves in the exam, and absolute score alone.
If the score passes a threshold set by the Bureau, the student is deemed 'proficient'.
If enough students hit 'proficient', the school is deemed 'proficient'.
However, students don't all start with the same level of academic mastery.
Matt Barnum noted that only 20% of 'variation in student achievement is explained by differences in schools', and that 'out-of-school factors, like poverty', have a 'significant effect on learning'.
With endowment funds of some of these semi-private DSS schools hitting more than HK$30 million, one can only imagine the uphill battle to keep up with the proficiency target for schools with less resources and more disadvantaged kids, and feel pity for the students who have fallen victim to a system stacked against them.
With so many factors affecting a student's abilities, the report concludes, implementing a proficiency-based exam will only 'reward schools for the students they take in', but not how they teach.
Impact of TSA-related stress on our bodies' poster and items commemorating students who ended their lives.
The 'growth' approach Educators have long debated the 'how' in evaluating school performance, and according to Brookings Institute, there is a 'growing consensus' among educators that an approach which measures student academic growth is more appropriate.
By setting rigorous and 'long-range' goals that span through multiple school years, the American Institute of Research found that teachers can bring 'students who perform far below proficiency to grade level'.
But perhaps the most convincing argument for a growth-based system is its ability to recognise that the definition of a 'rigorous yet attainable' proficiency level varies from student to student.
In a growth-based system, a teacher does not have to force students to do an unreasonable amount of exam drilling exercises, just to make sure students hit that arbitrary but all-important proficiency target.
With a system that 'recognizes teachers' efforts with all students
', a teacher can set 'a realistic learning goal for all students'.
While it is unfortunate that it took the tragedies of student suicide to bring renewed attention to pressures students face in school, a closer examination behind the causes of these pressures must continue.

Suicides rising among youth, survey finds  The number of young people committing suicide has continued to increase, data analysis by a suicide prevention centre shows.
The Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention estimates that the suicide rate for people aged between 15 and 24 was 8.9 per 100,000 last year – up from 8.4 per 100,000 the year before.
The suicide rate of people younger than 15 went up from 0.2 per 100,000 in 2015 to 0.5 per 100,000 last year.
The center said the overall number of suicide cases has been decreasing over the years, and the elderly remain the age group with the highest suicide rate.
But it also said the overall suicide rate in Hong Kong is on the lower side when compared globally.
The director of the centre, Paul Yip, said many NGOs provide support services for people who lose their loved ones to suicide.
A 15-year-old secondary school student has taken his own life on Sunday morning.
He was the third to die in four attempted suicides by Hong Kong students within eight days.
HK01 reported that his suicide may be related to worries over academic grades, as his secondary school was about to announce results.
Last Wednesday morning, a 12-year-old student attempted to take her own life at Lower Wong Tai Sin Estate, also reportedly due to academic pressure.
The latest incidents follow two student deaths from suicide immediately after the end of the Chinese New Year holidays.
35 cases of student suicide were reported last year.

Police said the victim might have committed suicide due to pressure from schoolwork.
The incident was the latest in a string of deaths by young students.
Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong Center for Suicide Research and Prevention said the incidents could be related to pressure from studies.
Hsu Siu-man, supervisor of the Youth Wellness Centers of the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, said students could be copying suicides from previous cases.
People should talk to others when they feel they are under pressure, Hsu said, adding that academic results are only part of a person's life.

Last week, in response to criticism from parents, teachers and many others, the chairman of the EDB's Committee on Prevention of Student Suicide, Professor Paul Yip, wrote a column in SCMP defending the committee's recent report.
' rather than recognizing the 'complexity of the suicide situation.
All serious research on suicide recognizes that there are usually multiple factors, nobody is suggesting otherwise, and this is a crude attempt to discredit anyone who dares to criticize the report.
A student suicide protest.
True, many of those who spoke up in Legco focused on the intense pressure that students experience in Hong Kong schools, but their testimony was largely a response to the clear attempt by the EDB and its hand-picked committee members to downplay or even deny a link between schoolwork and tests and the sort of psychological pressures that can lead to self-harm and suicide among students.
The report goes to great pains to avoid saying that academic pressure is an important factor in student suicide.
For instance, it claims 'there is no substantial direct link between student suicides and the education system.
But there are plenty of links, and  a mountain of clear evidence linking school and test pressure to student suicide.
The Social Welfare Department issued four 'Child Mortality Review' papers covering the years 2006 – 2011 that showed schoolwork pressures were linked to between 29% and 42% of youth suicides.
According to the Committee's report, the EDB's own data showed that 24% of Primary and Secondary school students who committed suicide were known to be worried about their academic performance, but this is somehow ignored in the report's conclusion.
Surveys conducted among Hong Kong students show an alarmingly high percentage consider suicide, and that the biggest sources of pressure in their lives are tests and homework.
Finally, many works of academic research have shown there is a strong link between school pressure and student suicide.
While the report makes a number of useful recommendations about increasing budgets for psychological support to students and parents, expanding service referral via the schools, and educating society about the risk of suicide, it fails to make any serious recommendations on how to reduce pressure on students.
Like a 2011 EDB guide on preventing student suicide, the report focuses on measures to help students learn how to deal with extreme pressure rather than trying to address the source of the pressure itself.
That proposal called for a 'paradigm shift' away from high-pressure tests, cramming, and rote memorization, and said that less testing and a 'flexible and open curriculum framework' would produce better long-term educational outcomes.
' We couldn't agree more, and we believe the evidence in this case is strong and clear: excessive testing, homework, and academic pressure may produce high test results, but they are overwhelming  Hong Kong's children and this must be faced head-on.
A frank and honest public discussion, followed by comprehensive reform of the education system is urgently required, because all Hong Kong students are at risk.
The president of the university slammed two students for putting up the posters, adding that a full investigation will be launched.
Alvin Ng said that Poon took his life due to "poor life planning" in a take on former education secretary Eddie Ng Hak-kim, who had linked poor life planning to a worrying spate of student suicides.
Media should refrain from over- reporting suicide news," Yip said.
A 17-year-old student from Guangdong has been arrested after allegedly organising a chat room group that disseminated messages on the 'Blue Whale' suicide game.
According to US-backed Radio Free Europe, the Blue Whale Challenge is a 'game' where teenage participants are ordered to perform one task every day – usually involving self-harm – ending with their suicides after 50 days.
The high school student told Zhanjiang police that he was invited into a chat group named 'Blue Whale suicide game' on May 9.
It is unclear whether any cases of self-harm or suicide in China or Hong Kong have been linked to the Blue Whale Challenge.

The call for caution comes after a netizen who claimed to be a student of the University of Hong Kong said in a Facebook post that three of his friends were suspected to be participating in the Blue Whale Challenge, also known as the Blue Whale suicide game.
On the final day, participants are urged to commit suicide so as to win the game, a sick challenge that has reportedly led to a number of young people ending up injured or dead around the world.
Professor Yip Siu-fai, director of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Center for Suicide and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, said he has been aware of the influences brought by the game.
A senior social worker told Headline Daily that Blue Whale Challenge is a suicide-promoting endeavor rather than a just game, as the online challenge systematically asks players to hurt themselves.
He asked all sections of society to stay on high alert to prevent the game from expanding online and prompting young people to form groups to commit suicide.
A 19-year-old Baptist University student from Tai Po took her own life on Monday afternoon – the third such case in four days.
The incident was possibly linked to academic pressure, and there were no suspicious circumstances, the police said.

On the same day, a Form Two student took her own life at her apartment block in Tin Shui Wai.
'no-suicide contract' was widely circulated on the internet, after seven student suicide cases emerged in the space of nine days.
The document came from an eBook published by the Bureau aimed at preventing student suicide.
It urged netizens to stop criticising the contract so that students who seek help will not lose confidence in the document.
No-suicide contract.
James Hon Lin-shan, the former chairman of the Council on Professional Conduct in Education, wrote on Monday in an Apple Daily column that the root cause of youth suicide is the Bureau's indifference to students' academic stress brought about by the imbalance and failure of the education curriculum.
Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim said in October that poor life planning is a reason students take their own lives.

A murder-suicide case shocked Hong Kong last week.
Yet, the media coverage of the murder-suicide case highlights a critical lack of understanding about the issue.
Although the homicide rate in Hong Kong remains comparatively low given the size of our population, the number of domestic murder-suicides among homicides features prominently.
Domestic homicide, murder-suicide cases and other forms of intimate partner violence don't happen in a vacuum.

Nearly 10 per cent of primary school students demonstrate symptoms of serious depression that require clinical attention, a new study has shown.
Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service distributed questionnaires among 1,301 primary three to primary six students across 14 schools between January and March this year.
The NGO estimated that over 33,000 of the 349,000 primary school students in the city suffer from clinical depression and require therapy and treatment.
Over a fifth of students said that they often experience stress from their heavy homework load, academic performance and preparation for secondary school.
The study also found that a lack of psychological resilience – meaning the ability to face pressure and handle emotions – was one of the biggest factors in childhood depression, and that these children tend to avoid things that trigger negative emotions and take to the extremity.
Social welfare sector lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun told Chief Executive Carrie Lam last month that there have been over 72 suicides among young people, from primary school students to postgraduate students, over the past two years.

The non-government organization surveyed 1,301 primary school students aged nine to 13 from 14 schools in Hong Kong in the first three months of the year.
Almost 10 percent of the students  showed serious depression symptoms and needed clinical attention, according to the findings.
While most students were found to not suffer from depression, 13.2 percent were troubled by depression symptoms, including 9.7 percent that required clinical attention.
"Estimating on the primary student population of this academic year, which is 349,008, the depressive tendency over 33,000 primary students has reached clinical level," a spokeswoman said.
More than 10 percent of students experienced symptoms such as fatigue and reported feeling useless, she said.
The NGO found that the lack of psychological resilience was the most prominent risk factor for depression among students.
But she said this could lead to more negative thoughts and affect their emotion and behavior, leading to serious consequences such as suicide.
Here I was, with a Primary One student, and the only thing that he noticed about the characters was whether they were winning or losing.

Suicide-bid son has mental issues
A former social worker who allegedly killed his mother before attempting suicide may have been suffering from depression, sources said.
Poor life planning is a reason students take their own lives, the Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim said on Friday.
The subjects that students picked at university might not have been what they were interested in, or what they were good at,' Ng said.
The committee was set up in March after seven student suicide cases emerged in the space of just nine days.
They might not have been able to stand the pressure from having to meet their own expectations, their family's expectations, and their peer's expectations,' Ng added.

Group seeks summit on suicides An alliance to help prevent student suicides urged the incoming chief executive to set up a "summit" of government and civil groups to prevent the loss of young lives.
About 10 members of the Civil Alliance for Student Suicide Prevention protested outside Champion Tower in Central, where Chief Executive-elect Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's office is  located.
Social-welfare sector legislator Shiu Ka-chun said they chose yesterday, Ching Ming Festival and Children's Day, as a memorial to the more than 60 students who have committed suicide since 2015.
The government also procrastinated in responding to the issue, and they shifted the blame to the students," he said.
The alliance reiterated that the Basic Competency Assessments for Primary Three pupils should be cancelled and urged that a summit to be chaired by the chief secretary be set up to lead interdepartmental work with students, parents, schools and civil groups to examine links between the education system and student suicides.
The Education Bureau is studying and following up on the report of the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides submitted in November, according to its online column "Insider's Perspective.
" Seminars will be held this month for schools and non- governmental organizations to pursue cooperation to enhance students' physical and psychological health, it said.
Meanwhile, an Israeli exchange student, 21, was found hanged in her room at Chinese University of Hong Kong International House Monday night.
The student, who held a Canadian passport, apparently left a suicide note.
It was unclear if they were students of Education University.
Tsoi, a former City University student, was arrested last year for threatening Alan Lo Ying-ki, a returning officer of the Registration and Electoral Office, after Hong Kong National Party convener Chan Ho-tin was barred from being nominated to run for the Legislative Council election.
Meanwhile, a group of principals warned Education University it will never hire its graduates, a student union leader said.
Lai said the university also reported that a number of students had their internships suspended after the incident.
Frederick Ma, the council chair of the Education University, has urged lawmakers not to put further pressure on students over a recent controversy at the teacher training school.
But in response, Ma urged all sides to stop putting pressure on students.
He also said that, even if those responsible for the posters were students at the university, their actions did not represent the entire school.
Student Union President Lai
Hiu-ching said she heard from top school officials that some schools said they will not employ Education University graduates, and internship opportunities for around ten students had been withdrawn.
He said he hoped the public could give the school some time to handle the situation, whilst it has yet to be confirmed whether the people involved were students at the school.
He added that if they were the university's students, they will be protected and given space to give the school an explanation of their actions.
HK Psychologists Concern has come out in support of the Education Bureau's 'no-suicide contracts' amid debate online.
The document came from an eBook published by the Education Bureau aimed at preventing student suicide.
It also asks the student to list a person that 'cares deeply' about them and 'does not want me to harm myself.
' No-suicide contract.
The contract could be helpful for students who may be in a confused state, as it would 'increase [the] chances of them remembering ways to help themselves when they are tempted to commit suicide,' it added.
It urged netizens to stop criticising the contract so that students who seek help will not lose confidence in the contract.
That if there wasn't such a contract more people would commit suicide?
Chow Tsz-yan, a teacher and student guidance officer
But according to experience, in cases where a relationship has already been established with the student, it is a fairly effective shield and can function as a gatekeeper.
The psychologists group added that, although it did not think there were problems with the 'no-suicide contract,' it said that the eBook published by the Education Bureau was 'difficult to understand and messy.
This month, Hong Kong saw seven student suicides in the space of nine days.

No-suicide pledge for youngsters backed A psychologists concern group has backed a no-suicide pledge put forth by the Education Bureau amid online debate that follows the increasingly worrying string of students killing themselves.
School social workers and counselors may ask students to sign the contract, according to the updated version of An eBook on Student Suicide for Schools: Early Detection, Intervention & Postvention.
Guidance personnel and social workers  are advised to intervene after identifying at-risk students and mobilize support from concerned parties.
They may provide individual counseling using seven tools,  one of which is the no-suicide contract.
The pledge asks the students to promise not to harm themselves and call 999 or 2896-0000 (The Samaritans) immediately if they feel like hurting themselves.
"People would be reminded of the pledge content, and the pledge would make  a troubled student focus on ways to help himself," it said.
"The pledge can help a student who is emotionally confused to focus on the simplest ways to help himself, such as finding helpers, calling an assistance hotline and ways to distract his attention from suicide."
The girl sent a text message to her classmate saying that she would commit suicide before her jump, local media reports said.
RTHK cited anonymous sources as saying that the flat was Choi's family residence, and that the eldest son had a record of depression and did not leave a suicide note.

Writing's on wall for uni suicide shame
The ruckus sparked by a banner congratulating education undersecretary Christine Choi Yuk-lin on the suicide of her 25-year-old son has been going on for a few days now.
There can only be two possibilities -  either Cheung is highly inefficient, or he's merely trying to protect students.
Would he have already told the public if the investigation had concluded the two people filmed putting up the banner were not students of the university?
Even worse, he's now telling us that even if those captured in the video were found to be his students, he wouldn't reveal their identities.
Students will keep challenging him, while politicians bombard him.
Unfortunate as it may be, if it is confirmed the culprits are students, Cheung won't be able to blame others for not having confidence in his graduates, of whom many will be teachers, who are expected to tell our youngsters to respect even those they may disagree with.
Students could post their views, but not stealthily.
For example, they had to disclose their student numbers to the administrators.
Now, the walls are no longer those where students had learned to be responsible for their opinions.
The students' union warned the university not to unleash white terror by pressing ahead with a witch-hunt.
Many of the students will be teachers one day, and have to deal with countless incidents of misbehavior day in, day out.
(EdUHK) has urged the public not to view its students as a problematic lot just because some offensive posters made their way onto the so-called democracy wall on the campus.
Appearing on a radio show, university council chairman Frederick Ma Si-hung called on people not to tar the EdUHK student community due to 'isolated incidents' on the campus.
In any case, it is not known if the university students were to blame for the vicious posters or some outside persons were behind the incidents, he said.
Ma cautioned that one cannot jump to the conclusion that EdUHK students are to blame.
In any case, they should be seen as isolated incidents and one should not implicate the entire student community, he said, according to Apple Daily.
I don't want the education sector to perceive that there are problems with all students at this university,' he said.
The remark came as Legislative Council member Ben Chan Han-pan had pushed for a petition that calls for the tracking down of the student responsible for the offensive messages and expel him or her.
Even if the school has found out who posted the slogan, they would not judge the case before they fully understand the motives and reasons for the student's actions, he said.
Apart from the poster mocking the deputy education chief Choi over her son's suicide, university authorities were looking into another offensive material that appeared on the democracy wall.
The university immediately notified the Student Union but had not waited for a reply before removing the posters.
The student union denounced the malicious messages, but sought to defend the poster activity in the name of freedom of speech, drawing further criticism from others.
Union president Lala Lai Hiu-ching, meanwhile, has demanded that EdUHK apologize for leakage of CCTV footage and lack of protection for the students.
The student unions of 13 local universities and tertiary institutions have jointly signed a statement condemning Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor for starting a witch-hunt over campus banners and posters.
On Tuesday, a video by SocRec showed a student who attempted to take down Hong Kong independence posters being confronted by student union members.
As a result, the mainland student has been both celebrated and condemned.
In recent days 'Hong Kong independence' members have been creating chaos, so some students came out to tear down their posters, and started 'we refuse to be represented' actions on social media – these self-motivated acts of justice are worthy of praise and encouragement.
He claimed that unions were not representative of all students, citing declining turnout numbers during elections.
He claimed that student unions were linked to pro-independence figures, and were acting as the 'pawns' of these figures.
This is why, whenever they do things, there are always students emphasising that 'the student union does not represent me,'' he said, referring to 'CUSU is not CU' posters that appeared on the 'Democracy Wall' managed by the student union.
In an interview with mainland news aggregator Guancha, the student declined to give her name, only revealing that she was from northern China, and saying she was afraid that other students would be able to find her.
Below the video posted on Facebook by SocRec, commenters attacked the student, saying she had no right to tear down the posters, and that her actions could constitute criminal damage.
The death of a Sichuan student who appeared to have fallen to his death from his dorm building has sparked widespread public anger in China, causing netizens, local residents and even official media to demand answers from local authorities.
A 14-year-old student surnamed Zhao was found dead on the ground outside a building at Taifu Middle School on Saturday.
According to the notice, if the authorities have already determined whether the child committed suicide or was killed by others before the autopsy results have come out, then what is the point of conducting an autopsy?
If the deceased committed suicide then where is the suicide note?
Arguments then broke out between Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking students.
That evening, Education University vice-chancellor Stephen Cheung told TVB that he would investigate CCTV footage to determine whether the perpetrators were students or outsiders.
The student union of Education University released a statement that evening condemning the leak of the screenshots to the media.
Different attitudes Student union President Lai
Lai also said she heard from top school officials at a meeting on the incidents that some schools had said they will not employ Education University graduates, and internship opportunities for around ten students were cancelled.
Lai said such actions would seriously affect students and she hoped the public should not make condemnations before the identities of people who pasted the posters were confirmed.
Even if the posters were pasted up by Education University students, what does it have to do with other students?
The three people later stopped by security staffers, who suspected the person was not a student.
A top Chinese general committed suicide after authorities opened an investigation against him over his links to two corruption-tainted former senior military officers, state media said Tuesday.

On January 24, Ronald Chin, president of the Hong Kong Baptist University, announced the suspension of two BU students who, on January 17, went with other students to the Language Centre to protest against the unfairness of the University's requirement that students to pass a Putonghua exam as a graduation prerequisite.
Chin alleged that the two students had threatened teachers at the centre physically and verbally but – as can be seen from the video record – only one student uttered a Cantonese word meaning 'dick', and no students used any violence.
Many Hongkongers think that it is discriminatory to require Hong Kong college students to pass a Putonghua exam as a prerequisite to graduate, while Mainland students studying in Hong Kong are not required to take any course or exam in Cantonese.
Students whose mother tongue is not Chinese or who have taken Chinese exams in China are exempted from the university's language requirement.
Last year, the school put forth a Putonghua exemption exam for local students too.
The students attribute this to the assessment standard being unclear.
On January 17, a few students, including Lau Chi-kei, chair of the HKBU Student Union, and Chan Lok-hang, a final year Chinese medicine student, went to the Language Centre of the Baptist University to ask the staff to explain how they assessed the students' Putonghua and to produce the rubrics concerned.
And despite the students' repeated requests, more senior staff at the university refused to talk to the students.
But as can be seen from the video, none of the students present at the scene uttered any other swearwords.
They did not even make any threatening gestures, although one expatriate teacher at the scene claimed that they were being threatened by the students.
Standoff between students and university staff.
Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the same day, the president of Baptist University announced temporary suspensions for both students for having breached the code of conduct by orally insulting and physically threatening teaching staff of the university.
For Cantonese is the mother tongue of most Hongkongers and university students.
Various student bodies, including the HKBU Student Union, Student Christian Movement of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Federation of Students, protested in support of the two suspended students and demanded the University cancel the Putonghua exam or test.
My heart just aches whenever I hear news of students taking their own lives.
And among the 75 deaths by unnatural causes, 20 of them were caused by suicides, with the youngest victim aged only 11.
Among these 20 suicide cases, 14 victims had shown suicidal signs such as emotional volatility and violent behavior before they ended their own lives.
I believe the key to preventing child and teen suicides is early detection and immediate intervention.
And both teachers and parents can indeed play an important role in preventing tragedy by constantly monitoring the psychological state of their students and children, particularly during the first few weeks of the new school year and seeking immediate help from psychiatric professionals if need be.
In the meantime, the government must devise solid plans and divert extra resources to support our schools and parents in their fight against student suicides.
And if necessary, the RPN can also refer students who need help to public mental health clinics run by the Hospital Authority (HA).
Once teachers or parents have noticed any warning sign of suicide among students, they can immediately refer the case to the RPN in their schools, who can then intervene with them as soon as possible and provide proper and timely help before tragedy strikes.
On the other hand, the RPN can also offer teachers and parents professional advice on how to meet the emotional needs of students and how to guide those who are struggling with emotional problems or stress-related depression.
I learned that the Food and Health Bureau, the Education Bureau as well as the Social Welfare Department jointly launched the Student Mental Health Support Pilot Scheme last year, under which the HA sent two RPNs to each of the nine local schools that volunteered to take part in the scheme.
I suggest that the one-school-one-nurse policy be extended to our tertiary institutions as well, under which university students can seek help from the RPNs directly through smartphone apps and social media.
Several media outlets including Now TV and i-Cable cited sources as saying that the government was not inclined to conduct cash handouts, but will give HK$2,000 to grassroots students who qualify for student subsidies and tuition remission schemes.
Around 220,000 students from kindergarten up to university level could benefit.
Ip said on a Commercial Radio programme on Tuesday that there are practical advantages in giving cash to grassroots students:
He said students at different levels have different needs: 'University students may need to pay for internet and they may dine out more, their needs may be bigger.
Primary school or kindergarten students who may not go out a lot have a different situation.
